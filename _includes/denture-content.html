Due to its transformation, Guhao Dental Lab needed some design help to create a fresh <span class="highlight">brand identity</span>, as well as help creating their very first <span class="highlight">public website</span> for promotion use.</p></div></div><div class="level" id="section2"><div class="container"><h2>BRAND IDENTITY</h2><div class="sep taller"></div></div></div><div class="level" id="section3"><div class="container"><h2>PUBLIC WEBSITE</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><p>I led the design and development of public website. The <span class="highlight">architecture</span> work was started first, then <span class="highlight">wireframes</span> and finally <span class="highlight">a live website</span> was created iteratively through the development phase.</p><h3>Architecture</h3><p>By dividing services and products into modules, I created the information architecture. From the top level, modules are:</p><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Home—landing page of the whole website</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Company—introduction, news, articles and partners of the company </span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Products—denture and orthodontic products, dental implants as a plus</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Trainee—program to educate and cultivate inexperienced apprentices</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Careers—job application</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Contact—page to contact the company</span></li></ul><img src="assets/img/ia.jpg"/><h3>Wireframes</h3><p>I then went through a quick process of wireframing. Some were sketched out by hand and some were created using computer.</p></div></div><div class="level level--humming-bird"><div class="container"><img src="assets/img/sketches.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3>Responsive Design</h3><p>Pages were designed for various screen sizes; they would adjust their layouts responsively.</p><h3>Navigation UI</h3><p>The top navigation bar is based on the information architecture mentioned before. And it would collapse into a hamburger menu on the mobile version.</p><h3>Results</h3></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h2>CONCLUSION AND REFLECTION</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><p> I felt really excited that I had the practical chance to rebrand a product, from bootstrapping the brand identity to building a public website. It made me more than happy seeing <span class="highlight">a finished product</span>, incorporating the ideas of design, technology as well as business.</p><p> More importantly, working with Guhao Dental Lab substantiated the value of <span class="highlight">collaboration</span>. Designers have to fully understand what their clients need before they dive into details. And I realized that the design should reflect the value of enterprise in order to stand out from other competitors.</p></div></div><nav class="dot-nav"><ul><li><a class="dot-nav--item" id="section1Nav" href="#section1"></a></li><li><a class="dot-nav--item" id="section2Nav" href="#section2"></a></li><li><a class="dot-nav--item" id="section3Nav" href="#section3"></a></li></ul></nav><div class="level"><div class="portfolio-nav-container"><div class="container"><a class="prev-container" href="startup.html"></a><a class="home-icon-container" href="index.html"></a><a class="next-container" href="bio.html"></a></div></div></div></div></div>
