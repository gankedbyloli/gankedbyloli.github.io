Due to this transformation, Guhao needed some design help to create a fresh <span class="highlight">brand identity</span>, as well as to build a <span class="highlight">public website</span> for promotional use.</p></div></div><div class="level" id="section2"><div class="container"><h2>BRAND IDENTITY</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><p>I started with creating a brand identity that sets the basic tone for further design and development.</p><h3>Goals</h3><p> Working closely with the founders, we first made sure that the key product questions were addressed in the <span class="highlight">creative brief</span>.</p><div class="board"><h3 class="smaller">Creative Brief</h3><h4>Who are the target audiences?</h4><p>The majority of audiences are dentists, dental clinics and stomatological hospitals. A minority would be patients whom are targeted directly.</p><h4>What makes Guhao unique?</h4><p> 1. <b>Accurate</b>—3D scanning eliminates unnecessary errors and improves the fidelity of dental model reconstructions; 2. <b>Rapid</b>—3D printing allows the lab to automate and optimize denture production workflows. 3. <b>Economical</b>—The production is very efficient because digitalization and 3D printing save the cost of energy and labor in a long run.</p><h4>What product characteristics does Guhao want to promote?</h4><p>Healthy, fast, economical, enduring and most importantly, high-tech.</p></div><h3>Inspirations</h3><p>After researching into the workflow, I gradually understood how things worked out in a dental lab and especially how 3D scanning and 3D printing influenced its production pipeline. I collected the following inspirations for logo design.</p></div></div><div class="level level--oyster-pink"><div class="container"><img src="assets/img/inspirations.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3>Logo</h3><p> The logo itself is an abstraction of tooth viewed in 3D space. It is created in a style that appears to be <span class="highlight">perspective, simple and modern</span>. The main idea is not only introducing <span class="highlight">the efficiency of advanced technology</span> but also preserving <span class="highlight">the proficiency of traditional craftsmanship</span>. </p><img class="img--result" src="assets/img/logo.jpg"/><p> The logo is divided into layers in its bottom half. Why? Because this explains how 3D printer works in prototyping—a wax pattern of denture model is built <span class="highlight">layer by layer</span>. Considering each layer a horizontal cross-section of the tooth, a 3D printer accumulates and stacks these layers, one upon the other, to form the final mass. </p><p>On the other hand, the geometry and space in between simulate the incisions <span class="highlight">carved out</span> by artisans, indicating the dedication to craftsmanship.</p><p>Below are a collection of logos in different themes.</p><img class="img--result" src="assets/img/logo-collection.jpg"/><p> The <span class="highlight">transformation</span> of the logo, from bottom to top, from layers to solid, reveals the workflow of producing dental products in Guhao. Meanwhile, the straight lines and sharp corners indicate the efficiency and proficiency the company has been equipped with.</p><h3>Color Palette</h3><p>With the metaphor of <span class="highlight">health and technology</span>, I chose to use cold colors of <span class="highlight">blue and green</span> to form the color pallete. Logo and the public website are consistent in regard of coloring.</p></div></div><div class="level level--oyster-pink"><div class="container"><img src="assets/img/pallete.png"/></div></div><div class="level" id="section3"><div class="container"><h2>PUBLIC WEBSITE</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><p>I led the design and development of public website. The <span class="highlight">architecture</span> work was started first, then <span class="highlight">wireframes</span> and finally <span class="highlight">a live website</span> was created iteratively through the development phase.</p><h3>Architecture</h3><p>By dividing services and products into modules, I created the information architecture. Top-level modules are:</p><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Home—landing page of the whole website</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Company—introduction, news, articles and partners of the company </span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Products—denture and orthodontic products, dental implants as a plus</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Trainee—program to educate and cultivate apprentices</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Careers—job application</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Contact—page to contact the company</span></li></ul><img src="assets/img/ia.jpg"/><h3>Wireframes</h3><p>I then went through a quick process of wireframing. Some were sketched out by hand and some were created using computer.</p></div></div><div class="level level--humming-bird"><div class="container"><img src="assets/img/sketches.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3>Responsive Design</h3><p> Pages were designed for <span class="highlight">various screen sizes</span>; they would adjust their layouts responsively.</p></div></div><div class="level level--humming-bird"><div class="container"><img src="assets/img/responsive.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3>Navigation UI</h3><p> The top navigation bar is based on the information architecture mentioned before. It would <span class="highlight">collapse</span> into a hamburger menu on the mobile version.</p></div></div><div class="level level--humming-bird"><div class="container">       <img src="assets/img/nav.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3>Results</h3><img class="img--result" src="assets/img/dental-home.png"/><img class="img--result" src="assets/img/dental-archive.png"/><img class="img--result" src="assets/img/dental-product.png"/><img class="img--title" src="assets/img/browser-title.png"/><img class="img--result" src="assets/img/dental-other.gif"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h2>CONCLUSION AND REFLECTION</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><p> I felt really excited that I had the practical chance to rebrand a product, from bootstrapping the brand identity to building a public website. It made me more than happy seeing <span class="highlight">a finished product</span>, incorporating the ideas of design, technology as well as business.</p><p> More importantly, working with Guhao Dental Lab substantiated the value of <span class="highlight">collaboration</span>. Designers have to fully understand what their clients need before they dive into details. And I realized that the design should reflect the value of an enterprise in order to stand out from competitors.</p></div></div><nav class="dot-nav"><ul><li><a class="dot-nav--item" id="section1Nav" href="#section1"></a></li><li><a class="dot-nav--item" id="section2Nav" href="#section2"></a></li><li><a class="dot-nav--item" id="section3Nav" href="#section3"></a></li></ul></nav><div class="level"><div class="portfolio-nav-container"><div class="container"><a class="prev-container" href="startup.html"></a><a class="home-icon-container" href="index.html"></a><a class="next-container" href="bio.html"></a></div></div></div></div></div>
