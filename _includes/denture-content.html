Due to this transformation, Guhao needed some design help to create a fresh <span class="highlight">brand identity</span>, to build a <span class="highlight">mobile app</span> that would indicate work efficiency and facilitate production pipeline, as well as to establish a <span class="highlight">public website</span> for promotional use.</p></div></div><div class="level" id="section2"><div class="container"><h2>BRAND IDENTITY</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><p>I started with creating a brand identity that sets the basic tone for further design and development.</p><h3>Goals</h3><p> Working closely with the founders, we first made sure that the key product questions were addressed in the <span class="highlight">creative brief</span>.</p><div class="board"><h3 class="smaller">Creative Brief</h3><h4>Who are the target audiences?</h4><p>The majority of audiences are dentists, dental clinics and stomatological hospitals. A minority would be patients whom are targeted directly.</p><h4>What makes Guhao unique?</h4><p> 1. <b>Accurate</b>—3D scanning eliminates unnecessary errors and improves the fidelity of dental model reconstructions; 2. <b>Rapid</b>—3D printing allows the lab to automate and optimize denture production workflows. 3. <b>Economical</b>—The production is very efficient because digitalization and 3D printing save the cost of energy and labor in a long run.</p><h4>What product characteristics does Guhao want to promote?</h4><p>Healthy, fast, economical, enduring and most importantly, high-tech.</p></div><h3>Inspirations</h3><p>After researching into the workflow, I gradually understood how things worked out in a dental lab and especially how 3D scanning and 3D printing influenced its production pipeline. I collected the following inspirations for logo design.</p></div></div><div class="level level--oyster-pink"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/nfXurLz.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3>Logo</h3><p> The logo itself is an abstraction of tooth viewed in 3D space. It is created in a style that appears to be <span class="highlight">perspective, simple and modern</span>. The main idea is not only introducing <span class="highlight">the efficiency of advanced technology</span> but also preserving <span class="highlight">the proficiency of traditional craftsmanship</span>. </p><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/nfE8cM2.jpg"/><p> The logo is divided into layers in its bottom half. Why? Because this explains how 3D printer works in prototyping—a wax pattern of denture model is built <span class="highlight">layer by layer</span>. Considering each layer a horizontal cross-section of the tooth, a 3D printer accumulates and stacks these layers, one upon the other, to form the final mass. </p><p>On the other hand, the geometry and space in between simulate the incisions <span class="highlight">carved out</span> by artisans, indicating the dedication to craftsmanship.</p><p>Below are a collection of logos in different themes.</p><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/xHjizRy.jpg"/><p> The <span class="highlight">transformation</span> of the logo, from bottom to top, from layers to solid, reveals the workflow of producing dental products in Guhao. Meanwhile, the straight lines and sharp corners indicate the efficiency and proficiency the company has been equipped with.</p><h3>Color Palette</h3><p>With the metaphor of <span class="highlight">health and technology</span>, I chose to use cold colors of <span class="highlight">blue and green</span> to form the color palette. Logo and the public website are consistent in regard of coloring.</p></div></div><div class="level level--oyster-pink"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/Ia3fD7I.png"/></div></div><div class="level" id="section3"><div class="container"><h2>MOBILE APP</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><p>I led the design work of a mobile app—Guhao Assistant for company's internal use.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Creating crowns, bridges and veneers in dental lab follows a strict sequence. Each technician is in charge of one specific step of the workflow. And he would pass the product onto the next one once finishing his own step. The company used to ask technicians to write down their names under the product's barcode in order to maintain data.</p><p>With a heavy switch to digital aided technologies, Guhao decided to make a new app that improves this process and therefore, benefits not only the company but also individual technicians.</p><h3>User Needs</h3><p>I started by doing user research. I found that 33 out of 35 technicians said that the action of writing down their names was tedious and pointless. I also interviewed 3 managers who would take extra time collecting, examining and recording data. They felt unintelligent and time-consuming. And all of them reported a frequent occurrence of error or missing data.</p><p>Therefore, the app was supposed to be <span class="highlight">simple</span>, <span class="highlight">encouraging</span> and <span class="highlight">reliable</span>, helping every company member who participated in the denture production pipeline.</p><div class="flex wider"><ol><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span> On the one hand, it would help <span class="highlight">an employee</span> put his work records into database, get reminded of everyday work progress, and understand his own work efficiency from the past.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>On the other hand, it would assist <span class="highlight">an employer</span> get up-to-date work status from the backend, keep track of every denture product and people that are involved, and make strategies based on reliable data.</span></li></ol></div><h3>Key Approaches</h3><p> The approach I designed to achieving <span class="highlight">simplicity</span> was using QR code or barcode scan. Technicians were given instant access to this technology throughout the app—once finishing their parts, they would tap a 'Scan' button and aim at the code of product with camera. After that, a record that bound them with the product would be saved automatically.</p></div></div><div class="level level--humming-bird"><div class="container">       <img class="lazyload" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/bEN5nOv.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><p>Data inserted by scanning could be used to compute key metrics related to work progress and efficiency. It was integrated into a dashboard and from that, a technician would understand his work status and be able to evaluate himself. This actually allowed the app to bring <span class="highlight">motivation and encouragement</span> to employees.</p></div></div><div class="level level--humming-bird"><div class="container">       <img class="lazyload" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/5VZoTR2.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><p> Since all employees were registered with their id and name, the app gave managers a <span class="highlight">reliable</span> way of searching to track any record. Moreover, in case the scanning functionality does not work, I also provided an alternative that technicians insert barcode manually.</p></div></div><div class="level level--humming-bird"><div class="container">       <img class="lazyload" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/ay8OwUG.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3>Use Cases</h3><p>After discussing with technicians, managers and stakeholders, I nailed down the required features. The key use cases I covered were:</p><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Log in and sign up</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>View today's work progress</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Scan the barcode to automatically insert a record upon finishing one's own step of the entire process</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>View work efficiency during a certain time elapse</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Search for a specific record of current employee</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Receive company notifications</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>View personal data and work summaries</span></li></ul><h3>Task Flows</h3><p>Below are some selected high-fidelity mobile screens and the screen flows.</p></div></div><div class="level level--humming-bird"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/7p502AU.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3>Results</h3><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Gh9xVhc.jpg"/></div></div><div class="level" id="section4"><div class="container"><h2>PUBLIC WEBSITE</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><p>I also led the design and development of public website. The <span class="highlight">architecture</span> work was started first, then <span class="highlight">wireframes</span> and finally <span class="highlight">a live website</span> was created iteratively through the development phase.</p><h3>Architecture</h3><p>By dividing services and products into modules, I created the information architecture. Top-level modules are:</p><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Home—landing page of the whole website</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Company—introduction, news, articles and partners of the company </span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Products—denture and orthodontic products, dental implants as a plus</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Trainee—program to educate and cultivate apprentices</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Careers—job application</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Contact—page to contact the company</span></li></ul><img class="lazyload" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/xR19LzU.jpg"/><h3>Wireframes</h3><p>I then went through a quick process of wireframing. Some were sketched out by hand and some were created using computer.</p></div></div><div class="level level--humming-bird"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/nGdo2YZ.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3>Responsive Design</h3><p> Pages were designed for <span class="highlight">various screen sizes</span>; they would adjust their layouts responsively.</p></div></div><div class="level level--humming-bird"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/6KbL2Gi.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3>Navigation UI</h3><p> The top navigation bar is based on the information architecture mentioned before. It would <span class="highlight">collapse</span> into a hamburger menu on the mobile version.</p></div></div><div class="level level--humming-bird"><div class="container">       <img class="lazyload" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/B9L1L31.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3>Results</h3><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/jKnQoL6.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/WaBIAFj.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/gnFhfrF.png"/><img class="lazyload img--title" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/PEdSuT3.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/1qqkobX.gif"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h2>CONCLUSION AND REFLECTION</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><p> I felt really excited that I had the practical chance to rebrand a product, from bootstrapping the brand identity, to designing a mobile app, to building a public website. It made me more than happy seeing <span class="highlight">a finished product</span>, incorporating the ideas of design, technology as well as business.</p><p> More importantly, working with Guhao Dental Lab substantiated the value of <span class="highlight">collaboration</span>. Designers have to fully understand what their clients need before they dive into details. And I realized that the design should reflect the value of an enterprise in order to stand out from competitors.</p></div></div><nav class="dot-nav"><ul><li><a class="dot-nav--item" id="section1Nav" href="#section1"></a></li><li><a class="dot-nav--item" id="section2Nav" href="#section2"></a></li><li><a class="dot-nav--item" id="section3Nav" href="#section3"></a></li><li><a class="dot-nav--item" id="section4Nav" href="#section4"></a></li></ul></nav><div class="level"><div class="portfolio-nav-container"><div class="container"><a class="prev-container" href="startup.html"></a><a class="home-icon-container" href="index.html"></a><a class="next-container" href="critique.html"></a></div></div></div></div></div>
