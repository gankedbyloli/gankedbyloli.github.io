For the sake of adapting to this unique and ever-evolving market, China team strategized <span class="highlight">rich marketing and operation plans</span>, with their focus on <span class="highlight">customer acquisition and retention</span>. </p></div></div><div class="level" id="section1"><div class="container"><h2>BIG PICTURE</h2><div class="sep"></div><h3>Background</h3><p>In the beginning, quick solutions including marketing landings, operation campaigns, SMS and push notifications were executed to address immediate business needs, aiming for more traffic as well as more engagement.</p><h3>General Problems</h3><p>After piloting a few marketing and operation programs, results were less than satisfactory. Three critical issues were identified on the product and design side.</p><div class="flex wider"><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span> <b>No infrastructure</b>—there were neither standardized workflow nor tools to enable it; few services, features or design elements were reusable.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span> <b>Extremely low productivity</b>—technical dependencies were complicated, communication cost high, and human resources lacked.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span><b>Misalignment between products and business operations in terms of design direction</b>—few designers were involved, and those early programs did not carry the same personality as our apps and sites.</span></li></ul></div><h3>High-level Solution—a Business Tool Suite</h3><p>As the only product designer on the team, I suggested we build <span class="highlight">a platform incorporating a matrix of tools</span>, with each of them catering to one major need from the business. </p><p>Similar to the system of differentiation defined in <span class="highlight">Gartner's pace-layered application strategy</span>, this tool suite, on the one hand, communicates with core algorithms and databases, on the other hand, provides APIs so that it is adaptive and agile enough to support various service calls and frequent front-end changes.</p></div></div><div class="level level--humming-bird"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/507ac45e/43ad3b5d.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><p>Objectives of the tool suite were:</p><div class="flex wider"><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Facilitate an effective and sustainable workflow across teams; provide reusable services, features or design elements</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Decouple dependencies, reduce communication cost and free up human resources</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Set up design direction and generate pattern library to align business with products</span></li></ul></div><p>I will choose <span class="highlight">one representative tool</span> that best showcases what the problems were and how we solved them.</p></div></div><div class="level" id="section2"><div class="container"><h2>CMS FOR CAMPAIGN PAGE</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><h3>Problem</h3><p>Campaign pages are extremely common in Chinese e-commerce platforms. One of their distinguishing characteristics is that they are <span class="highlight">content-focused</span>. Content, though taking various forms, is usually created, grouped and organized based on business impact or customer interest. Examples are listed.</p></div></div><div class="level level--oyster-pink"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/e197b249/8006bc10.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><p>By working closely with the operation team, we understood our <span class="highlight">internal needs</span> were:</p><div class="flex wider"><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Can rapidly create, group and organize unique content for each campaign</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Can flexibly change and deploy content</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Can follow guidelines to ensure design quality</span></li></ul></div><p>On the other hand, our <span class="highlight">customer needs</span> were:</p><div class="flex wider"><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Can browse and navigate through content easily</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Can understand the theme that content reflects</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Can build up interest by viewing properties, incentives or travel-related articles</span></li></ul></div><p>Thus, our goals were inferred—first, <span class="highlight">to achieve self-service campaign creation, implementation, and modification</span>; second,  <span class="highlight">to strike a balance between weight, quality, and entropy of content such that customers understood and became interested</span>.</p><p>This yields a <span class="highlight">Content Management System</span>.</p><h3>1. Structure and Hierarchy</h3><p>The first step I took was understanding the structure and hierarchy of content. I wanted to <span class="highlight">identify and extract patterns that can be generalized</span> into tools and processes.</p><p>Since we mainly listed featured properties, incentives, or articles, I categorized all campaigns into two: <span class="highlight">commodity-focused</span> and <span class="highlight">inspiration-focused</span>. The former exploits business opportunities, incentivizing customers to book immediately while the latter offers an inspirational context to trigger customer interest before any travel plan.</p><p>I created <span class="highlight">mind mappings</span> of the two—different page elements were generalized and extracted. Each of them fell into a specific hierarchy, whether it was <span class="highlight">a template, a pattern, a component, or an atom</span>. </p></div></div><div class="level level--humming-bird"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/c47ee0a6/3de476ac.png"/><img class="lazyload" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/fc9376a3/f8f5974a.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><p> This approach, in a very logical way, showed elements and their associations. Besides, I saw strong correlations between the results and the information architecture of CMS. </p><p>Note that I left items that were optional or foreseeable as placeholders, making the system <span class="highlight">robust and scalable</span> in the long run. </p><h3>2. Content Generation Flow</h3><p>The process of forming a content structure was essentially an inverse of how I decomposed it. The concept is similar to <span class="highlight">Atomic Design</span> in which everything begins with the smallest element of the interface: the atom, then forms molecule, organism, template and eventually the page.</p></div></div><div class="level level--humming-bird"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/11fafaaf/b3de4411.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><p>This process brought insights to the workflow that our operation team would follow to generate content: <span class="highlight">1. create a blank page</span>, <span class="highlight">2. choose a template</span>, <span class="highlight">3. create modular sections</span>, <span class="highlight">4. add components</span>, and <span class="highlight">5. populate data, copy and visual elements</span>.</p><h3>3. Design Values and Guidelines</h3><p>Although campaign content is highly diversified and flexible, it should not drift too much away from the personality that our products have already had. In this case, we wanted to  <span class="highlight">set up a design guideline</span> that generated content can automatically follow.</p><p>Extensive research was conducted to figure out opportunities that lay within brand identity, products, and customer expectations.</p><div class="board"><h3 class="smaller">Highlighted Research Questions</h3><h4>What is the main message our brand tries to deliver?</h4><p>Our brand encourages everyone to travel boldly using the reliable services we provide.</p><h4>What is the mental model in which our loyal customers think of us?</h4><p>In the focus group, we found out 1) pros: Booking.com had various properties, trusted reviews and easy booking process 2) cons: there were few incentives and little inspiration they could get. </p><h4>What are the design values we need to keep anyway?</h4><p>We design for people. Our job is to make it as <b>simple and effective</b> as possible for everyone involved to succeed when they interact with our service.</p><h4>What are the aspects that a campaign page can differ from the products?</h4><p> We want to get our customers attracted and inspired. We want to introduce an <b>interesting and enjoyable</b> atmosphere.  </p></div><p>By envisioning the campaign page and comparing it to our general product, we discovered generality in terms of clarity and effectiveness, yet peculiarity in terms of intriguing and delightful experience. Therefore we decided to set <span class="highlight">clarity and interestingness</span> as our design values.</p><p>The next step was to translate the values into something tangible. Here, I want to highlight three foundations that push them forward. They are <span class="highlight">rounded shapes, white space, and subtle gradients.</span></p><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/7753aca1/7c75bc3e.png"/><p>For example, I followed these basics when exploring variants of property cards.</p></div></div><div class="level level--humming-bird"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/bca536e1/2f51eb05.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><p>It was important that the guideline not be simply comprised of UI elements, but also more molecular pieces that need to be used across the experiences in campaigns. Thus, I transformed similar variants into <span class="highlight">generic</span> components. I also dissected the generic component and rethought about its variations by adding or removing an atom in it.</p></div></div><div class="level level--humming-bird"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/56033e38/7e80e16c.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><p>In this way, we gradually established and enriched the <span class="highlight">design pattern library</span>.</p><h3>Mock-ups</h3><p>For the content management system itself, we use <span class="highlight">Ant Design</span> as its nature and determinacy help our internal users finish their jobs effectively and efficiently.</p><p>Our internal users would first initiate a new campaign and select a template for it by choosing commodity-focused or inspiration-focused.</p><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/74dd5335/9ba12285.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/9a3312f2/6a87f077.png"/><p>The tool then led them to set up the new page properly including basics, sections, and navigations.</p><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/e9819504/00635bd4.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/3b8dbc1a/e289dc64.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/d6c9dc49/53e1e78b.png"/><p>Section modules, in particular, were categorized according to previous mind mappings. To name a few, we have coupons, destinations, co-brandings, and properties as the module types. </p><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/c5ce408d/2f9a0a33.png"/><p>After creating a new section module, our internal users populate specified components inside. For example, they could add various properties to a module and decide how to group and prioritize them within it. More importantly, they could select one of the layout options that are compliant with our design values.</p><p> Therefore, even though it is quite flexible to generate the content, our design guideline helps us <span class="highlight">ensure clarity and consistency</span>.</p><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/417ecee8/9cc729cd.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/051da387/2f835157.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/006604a1/d1c0a44e.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/2a6a22c8/f8e42298.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/8b16609c/1f164684.pngg"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/02d1e93d/d8be9978.png"/><p> We saw <span class="highlight">significant performance improvement</span> after we launched this tool. In respect of productivity, we saved 3-days working time per person on each campaign and were able to run operation campaigns on a weekly basis.
