In order to adapt to this unique and ever-evolving market, China team quickly strategized <span class="highlight">rich marketing and operation plans</span> for the purpose of <span class="highlight">customer acquisition and retention</span>. </p></div></div><div class="level" id="section1"><div class="container"><h2>BIG PICTURE</h2><div class="sep"></div><h3>Background</h3><p>In the beginning, quick solutions including marketing landings, operation campaigns, SMS and push notifications were created to address immediate business needs, aiming for more traffic as well as more engagement.</p><h3>General Problems</h3><p>However, after piloting a few marketing and operation programs, results were less than satisfactory. Three critical issues were discovered from the product and design side.</p><div class="flex wider"><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span> <b>No infrastructure</b>—there were neither standardized workflow nor tools to enable that; few services, features or design elements were reusable.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span> <b>Extremely low productivity</b>—technical dependencies were everywhere, communication cost was high and human resources were lacked.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span><b>A disconnection between product and business operations in terms of design</b>—few designers were involved and those early programs did not carry the same personality as our apps and sites.</span></li></ul></div><h3>High-level Solution—a Tool Suite</h3><p>As the only product/UX designer on the team, I suggested we build <span class="highlight">a platform incorporating a matrix of tools</span>, with each of them catering to one major need from the business. Similar to the system of differentiation, as defined in <span class="highlight">Gartner's pace-layered application strategy</span>, this tool suite, on the one hand, communicates with core algorithms and databases, on the other hand, provides various APIs so that it is adaptive and agile enough to support different service calls and frequent front-end changes.</p></div></div><div class="level level--humming-bird"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/SSsh51f.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><p>Objectives of the tool matrix were:</p><div class="flex wider"><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Facilitate an effective and sustainable workflow across teams; provide reusable services, features or design elements</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Decouple dependencies, reduce communication cost and free up human resources</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Set up design direction as it generates pattern library to align business with product</span></li></ul></div><p>I will choose <span class="highlight">one representative tool</span> to best showcase what the problems were and how we solved them.</p></div></div><div class="level" id="section2"><div class="container"><h2>CMS - CAMPAIGN PAGE</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><h3>Problem</h3><p>Campaign pages are extremely common in Chinese e-commerce platforms. One of their distinguishing characteristics is that they are <span class="highlight">content-focused</span>. Content, though taking various forms, is usually created, grouped and organized based on business impact or customer interest. Some examples are listed.</p></div></div><div class="level level--oyster-pink"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Um60m7d.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><p>By working closely with the operation team, we understood our <span class="highlight">internal needs</span> were:</p><div class="flex wider"><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Can rapidly create, group and organize unique content for each campaign</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Can flexibly change and deploy content as needed</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Can follow design guidance to ensure quality</span></li></ul></div><p>On the other hand, our <span class="highlight">customer needs</span> were:</p><div class="flex wider"><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Can browse and navigate through content easily</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Can understand the main theme that content reflects</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Can build up interest by viewing properties, incentives or travel-related articles</span></li></ul></div><p>Thus, our goals can be inferred—<span class="highlight">to achieve self-service campaign creation, implementation and modification</span>, and <span class="highlight">to strike balance between weight, quality and entropy of the content in the meantime</span>.</p><p>This yields a <span class="highlight">Content Management System</span>.</p><h3>1. Structure and Hierarchy</h3><p>The first step I took was understanding the structure and hierarchy of content. I wanted to <span class="highlight">identify and extract patterns that can be generalized</span> into tools and processes.</p><p>Since our main approach is listing featured properties, incentives, or articles, I categorized all campaigns into two: <span class="highlight">commodity-focused</span> and <span class="highlight">inspiration-focused</span>. The former exploits business opportunity, incentivizing customers to book immediately while the latter is seen as an inspirational source to trigger customer interest before any travel plan.</p><p>I created <span class="highlight">mind mappings</span>—for each category, different page elements were generalized and extracted. Each of them fell into a specific hierarchy, whether it was <span class="highlight">a template, a pattern, a component, or an atom</span>. </p></div></div><div class="level level--humming-bird"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/UIQyrWL.png"/><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/pd4LnWP.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><p> Note that I included items that were optional or foreseeable in the future. Creating placeholders for them would make the CMS <span class="highlight">robust and scalable</span> in the long run. The results highly correlated with the final information architecture of the CMS. </p><h3>2. Generation Flow</h3><p>The content generation flow was essentially an inverse of how I decomposed it. The concept is similar to <span class="highlight">Atomic Design</span> in which everything begins with the smallest element of the interface: the atom, then forms molecule, organism, template and eventually the page.</p></div></div><div class="level level--humming-bird"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/L092Jy9.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><p>Our operation team would follow similar steps to generate content: <span class="highlight">create a blank page</span>, <span class="highlight">choose a template</span>, <span class="highlight">create modular sections</span>, <span class="highlight">add components</span>, and finally <span class="highlight">populate data, copy and visual elements</span>.</p><h3>3. Design Values and Guideline</h3><p>Although campaign content is highly diversified and flexible, it should not drift away from the personality that our products have already had. In this case, we wanted to  <span class="highlight">set a design direction</span> that all generated content can automatically follow.</p><p>Extensive research was conducted to figure out opportunities that lay within brand identity, products, and customer expectations.</p><div class="board"><h3 class="smaller">Highlighted Research Questions</h3><h4>What is the main message our brand tries to deliver?</h4><p>Our brand encourages everyone to travel boldly using the reliable services we provide.</p><h4>What is the mental model in which our loyal customers think of us?</h4><p>In the focus group, we found out 1) pros: Booking.com had various properties, trusted reviews and easy booking processes 2) cons: there were few incentives and little inspiration they could get. </p><h4>What are the design values we need to keep anyway?</h4><p>We design for people. Our job is to make it as <b>simple and effective</b> as possible for everyone involved to succeed when they interact with our service.</p><h4>What are the aspects that a campaign page can differ from the products?</h4><p> We want to get our customers attracted and inspired. We want to introduce an <b>interesting and enjoyable</b> atmosphere.  </p></div><p>While comparing campaign pages to our general products, we found generality in terms of clarity and effectiveness, yet peculiarity in terms of intriguing and delightful experience. Therefore we decided to use  <span class="highlight">clarity and interestingness</span> as our design values for campaign pages.</p><p>The next step was to translate them into something tangible that could be the foundation of every campaign. Here, I want to highlight three basics that push our values forward. They are <span class="highlight">rounded shapes, white space, and subtle gradients.</span></p><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/o9O395H.png"/><p>For example, I followed the basics when designing variants of property cards.</p></div></div><div class="level level--humming-bird"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/T3Ek7xu.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><p>Variants were specific components. I then transformed a group of similar components into a <span class="highlight">generic</span> one that was reusable. I also dissected the generic component and rethought about its variations by adding or removing an element of it.</p></div></div><div class="level level--humming-bird"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/9VFbhIn.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><p>In this way, we gradually established and enriched the <span class="highlight">design pattern library</span>.</p><h3>Mock-ups</h3><p>For the content management tool itself, we used <span class="highlight">Ant Design</span> as its design language, providing clear information and navigation for the internal users. Below are some mock-ups.</p><p>Our internal users would first initiate a new campaign and select a template for it by choosing commodity-focused or inspiration-focused.</p><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/oc039ZH.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Cy39Thg.png"/><p>The tool then led them to set up the new page properly including basics, sections and navigations.</p><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/lgAlCT7.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/eUG4vmk.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/tykS0KD.png"/><p>Section modules, in particular, were categorized according to the mind mappings previously. To name a few, we have coupons, destinations, co-brandings and properties as our modules. </p><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/a0W6Smz.png"/><p>Users create any section and populate components inside. For example, they could create a section containing a variety of properties. They could decide how to group and prioritize, or which elements need to be surfaced. Even though it is quite flexible to generate the content, users could still ensure a clear and consistent UI style.</p><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/6ewFrYH.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/R9Dggrg.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/zoxDQsB.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/GB6EHfl.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/n9wEfjB.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/AtkcCKf.png"/><p> After launching the new tool, we saw <span class="highlight">a significant performance increase</span> from the generated campaign pages. In terms of productivity, we saved 20 people day in total per campaign. In terms of quality, the number of interactions happened inside a campaign page also increased by 35% on average.</p></div></div><div class="level" id="section3"><div class="container"><h2>RESULTS</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><p>Finally, here are some operation campaign pages that went live thanks to the content management system.</p></div></div><div class="level level--oyster-pink"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/ToH8kWQ.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><p>Other affiliated tools that facilitated sourcing and publishing for operation campaigns were also built. Combining tools for marketing landing pages, coupon issuing, SMS and push notifications, we were able to establish a tool suite to <span class="highlight">drive business growth</span>.</p></div></div><nav class="dot-nav"><ul><li><a class="dot-nav--item" id="section1Nav" href="#section1"></a></li><li><a class="dot-nav--item" id="section2Nav" href="#section2"></a></li><li><a class="dot-nav--item" id="section3Nav" href="#section3"></a></li></ul></nav><div class="level"><div class="portfolio-nav-container"><div class="container"><a class="prev-container" href="bio.html"></a><a class="home-icon-container" href="index.html"></a><a class="next-container" href="startup.html"></a></div></div></div></div></div>
