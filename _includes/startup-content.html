In this article I will select three milestones during the design/development process and I will analyze each of them from strategy to interface.</p></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h2>OVERVIEW</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><h3>About the company</h3><p>Tran3D is <span class="highlight">an online 3D printing service platform where distributed 3D printing resources are gathered, shared, and applied</span>.</p><h3>How it works</h3><p> Tran3D runs a C2C business model. It facilitates transactions between <span class="highlight">3D printer owners and people who want to make 3D prints</span>. Service bureaus can join the platform to offer 3D printing services while customers can select one of the best solutions we recommend to get their 3D models printed.</p><h3>My roles</h3><p> Being one of the co-founders, I led the <span class="highlight">UI/UX design and front-end development</span> from start to finish in the past one year. </p><p>As a designer, I worked on</p><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>User research</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Sketches and wireframes</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Visual and interaction design</span></li></ul><p>As a developer, I was responsible for</p><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Writing reusable CSS</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Building application based on AngularJS and Three.js</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Designing API endpoints that could collaborate with back-end</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Loading modules with oc-lazyload and Webpack</span></li></ul><h3>How I started</h3><p>At the early stage of a startup company, <span class="highlight">I wanted to deliver a minimum viable product as soon as possible.</span> I also wanted to provide a flexible structure that could scale naturally as the website grows. So I started with architecture and decomposed it into modules.</p><p>Next, I will select three representatives and go through their design processes and implementation results.</p></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h2>START A 3D PRINT</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><h3>The Problem</h3><p>3D printing features rapid prototyping and product customization. It enables consumer products to be made on­-demand, eliminating the restriction to craftsmanship and manufacture, as well as reducing the waste from overproduction and overpricing. So here comes the problem—<span class="highlight">how can I get customers onboard and fully deliver such quality of 3D printing to them?</span></p><h3>The Analysis</h3><p>To introduce complex technology home, Tran3D must provide customers with an easy and fast channel to getting their hands on real 3D printed products. <span class="highlight">The main idea was to build a module that helps users start a 3D print and guides them quickly through a customization workflow before they reach the shopping cart.</span> I called it "Start a 3D Print" and then identified some core principles:</p><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Prominent call-to-actions—Highlighted elements draw attentions and trigger interests. </span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Refined steps—Tasks that are easier to do are a better starting point for people with low motivation (see BJ Fogg Behavior Model).</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Limited choices—It’s often easier to make a decision when presented with only a few options.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Hidden expert-level interfaces and terminologies—Expert users are only the minority.</span></li></ul><p>Overall, I wanted to make this module accessible and easy to customers and boost user engagement. The customization workflow of 3D printing should be <span class="highlight">lucid</span>, <span class="highlight">fast</span>, <span class="highlight">efficient</span>, and <span class="highlight">interesting</span>.</p><h3>The Exploring</h3><p> Based on the analysis, I started my exploration by scoping the workflow into three phases: <span class="highlight">Upload Your Models</span>, <span class="highlight">Select a Material</span>, and <span class="highlight">Choose a 3D Printing Service</span>. In this way, a complex and tedious process was effectively decomposed into parts whose tasks are easier to understand and goals are clearer to achieve.</p><p>I then started to play with a few key design concepts by creating mid-fidelity wireframes. Those concepts were:</p><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Create visually striking buttons that compel users to click. For example, 'Start a 3D Print' button at the top navigation draws attentions and gives everybody a direct access to getting started. Besides, 'Next' buttons between steps provide natural leads and transitions, which help users move forward.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Integrate all three phases in one page for an unbreakable experience. This integrity keeps data consistent and interaction coherent. And if you accidentally do something that doesn’t produce the results you were looking for, you could scroll backward for any small corrections without repeating the whole process.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Unlock the next phase until the current one is completed. Loading the customization workflow once for all adds unnecessary choices on the screen, which could heavily distract users from focusing on the current step. On the contrary, loading step by step provides better guidance and creates more interesting interactions to the system. </span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Prioritize imperative parameters, use straightforward wording and hide expert-level content. Complex interfaces and terminologies are not only overwhelming for beginners, but could also be difficult to use for experts in certain cases. Hiding some of the unimportant terminologies like 'Infill Ratio' or '3D Printing Technology' into advanced tabs could be a choice.</span></li></ul><h3>The Result</h3><p> After unifying data structure with the team, I finalized the flow as indicated below. It creates <span class="highlight">a clear sense of assistance</span> and <span class="highlight">reduces the unnecessity</span> to minimum so that most non-expert users can understand how things work without any direct explanation. Useful images and friendly language are added throughout. It also has animations and transitions, which adds a bit of fun. I am optimistic that users will get onboard and progress through all three phases without friction, leading to successful customizations of their 3D printable products.</p></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h2>DISCOVER A USER</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><h3>The Problem</h3><p> Tran3D in essence is a 3D printing community where users design, prototype, sell and buy custom products and services. However, different users have different roles. Given a user, <span class="highlight">how can we distinguish his roles from others'; which functions should we assign to him; and how can we help showcase his characteristics and develop his own "brand"?</span></p><h3>The Analysis</h3><p> <span class="highlight">Upon discovering a user, one has to identify that person's roles and characteristics intuitively and efficiently. </span><span class="highlight">Designers</span> productively transfer their concepts into printable designs. <span class="highlight">Manufacturers</span> register 3D printers and promote their products. And like <span class="highlight">the rest of individuals</span>, both can follow, collect or purchase what they are interested in. According to this, I listed some keywords to better guide my design.</p><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Architecture—Interpreting underlying data structure and class inheritance into information architecture reduces confliction between design and development.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Hierarchy—The item that first grabs the eye’s attention is at the top of the hierarchy. Each item that draws attention next is subordinate to the one before it.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Coloring—One of the easiest ways to distinguish objects is through colors.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Personalization—Users are more likely to get motivated if provided more personalized choices.</span></li></ul><h3>The Exploration</h3><p>I made these design decisions:</p><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>I separated users into three categories: common individuals, designers and manufacturers. All types shared a same template—Basic information was listed out and designs, collections, orders, followings and followers were organized into tabs. However, it is worth noting that designers were given an extra section to introduce their backgrounds, concepts and portfolios while manufacturers were given a shop page and a dashboard to manage printers, orders and etc in the shop.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>I used the Z Pattern—Our eye starts scanning from top left to top right, then diagonally down to bottom left, stopping at the bottom right. Therefore, the sequence of displaying user information was avatar and name first, followed by content categories, and list of specific items last.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>I chose to use the color palletes from flat design and then provided clear and accurate labeling. The personality is bold and stands out. </span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>I highlighted 'Register', 'Create' and 'Follow' buttons and encouraged users to personalize their profiles when they were lack of activities. The more they participate, the easier to showcase their personality and to find their friends. Also, user behaviors such as creating and collecting were included in the home feed, which kept the character active in social network.</span></li></ul><h3>The Result</h3></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h2>MANAGE SHOP SERVICES</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><h3>The Problem</h3><p>Tran3D manages and schedules 3D printing services based on data and facts. To better SEO and discoverability, it is important for manufacturers to provide authentic and intriguing data. This is a non-trivial work: </p><ol><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Data encompasses various facets of 3D printing—There are printers, materials, colors, layout thicknesses, and pricing strategies, to name a few.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Pricing strategies are extremely complex—The disparity of strategies is of all aspects and the strategies are hard to understand if translated into mathematical model.</span></li></ol><p>Therefore how can I help them upload the data in an intuitive way and how can I better organizing the data for a clearer reference?</p><h3>The Analysis</h3><p>To get better insights in manufacturers, I interviewed some people that owns 3D printers about products and marketing. With these insights I made three personas. The personas reveal the listed user needs.</p><ol><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Hierarchical—It is easier to navigate and understand the system by organizing content Hierarchically.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Complete—More complete data increases a manufacturer's credibility, therefore popularity.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Intuitive—Uploading data is easy, not learned.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Standardized—Data and related evaluations are using the same standard so that users can understand.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Flexible—The system provides the manufacturer choices to develop their own personality.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Foreseeable—Any preview of the outcome would help manufacturers circumvent mistakes, lowering the possibility of failed strategies.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Reversible—Data that is incorrect or outdated can be removed or modified.</span></li></ol><h3>The Exploration</h3><p>During the design process, I tried to deliver the ideas above. And I will illustrate one by one:</p><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Divide concepts into hierarchy. A manufacturer may not have enough motivation to publish all service data in a single upload. So I divided the whole process, and organized them into layers. A user could go to their shop settings page and upload their 3D printers first. Second, under one of his printers, he could add materials and related information. Note that a printer is not in active status until its materials are added.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Include features that helps SEO. Titles, tags, descriptions, photos and categories are provided for manufacturers to better describe their services. These features can be catchy and descriptive to someone outside of their niches, speak aloud for their services. </span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Utilize shapes and colors.  One of the most difficult problem is the interaction design for making a pricing strategy since it has so many variables and it is so flexible. A common mathematical model of pricing strategies is linear polynomial. It is an add-up of multiple terms which come from a coefficient multiplies a variable. Besides, the number of terms depends on specific use case. Here, I tried to illustrate this polynomial using simple shapes and colors. I found that by building a one-to-one correspondence between a term and a color could effectively solve the problem.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Unify layouts, interactions and paradigms. I chose to move forward with the page component that repetatively showed up—the modal. This was because I did not want to overwhelm the user with both an unfamiliar UI and an unfamiliar interaction. I tried to make users concentrated on what they are doing by popping out a modal. Within the modal, there is a top nav indicating the progress of uploading data. In terms technical paradigms, units of measurement and math formulas are both standardized. Manufacturers in Tran3D must obey these rules. For example, manufacturers have to use linear polynomial instead of a quadratic one for market unity.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Open alternatives for users with different backgrounds. This time, it is necessary to provide choices in order to manage shop services. Not every blank in the form is required. For example, manufacturers could enable factors that is particular important to them in the linear polynomial. They could even disable the default factors as long as they use the provided formula.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Provide preview and simulate results. After proposing a pricing strategy, users will get a preview of what the price would be if the pricing strategy is applied to a test case we provided. They could adjust different parametrics and get an immediate response. This function not only makes life easier for data analysts who want to find a suitable mathematical model, but also makes the user feel powerful so that he can trust our system.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Provide CRUD operations. Service data like printers, materials and even pricing strategies are revisable by manufacturers if they made any mistakes.</span></li></ul><h3>The Result</h3></div></div></div></div>
