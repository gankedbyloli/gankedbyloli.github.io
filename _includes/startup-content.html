In this article, I would like to share with you some of my designs from strategy to interface.</p></div></div><div class="level" id="section1"><div class="container"><h2>OVERVIEW</h2><div class="sep"></div></div></div><div class="level level--tropical-blue"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/FpzrWEV.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3>About the project</h3><p>Tran3D is <span class="highlight">an online 3D printing service platform</span> where distributed 3D printing resources are gathered, shared, and applied.</p><h3>How it works</h3><p> Tran3D runs a C2C business model. It facilitates transactions between <span class="highlight">3D printer owners and people who want to make 3D prints</span>. Service bureaus can join the platform to offer 3D printing services while customers can select one of the best solutions we recommend to get their customized models printed.</p><h3>My roles</h3><p> Being one of the co-founders, I led the <span class="highlight">UI/UX design and front-end development</span> from start to finish.</p><p>As a designer in particular, I worked on</p><div class="flex wider"><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>User research</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Product design</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Sketches, wireframes and mock-ups</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Visual and interaction design</span></li></ul></div><h3>How I started</h3><p>Working closely with my partners, I first made a Q&A sheet that depicted our potential users.</p><div class="board"><h3 class="smaller">User Brief</h3><h4>Who are the target audiences?</h4><p>Modern people who enjoy customizing things or transforming ideas into reality using technology.</p><h4>What are the audience types and their differences?</h4><p> There are three main types. 1. <b>Common individuals</b>—people who need 3D printed products, but without 3D printers; 2. <b>Designers</b>—people who are capable of producing high-quality 3D models; 3. <b>Manufacturers</b>—people who own 3D printers, can either be individuals or companies.</p><h4>Where can audiences be found?</h4><p>Most likely, they can be found in universities or manufactural industry. They might also have active accounts in 3D print forums.</p><h4>What personality does Tran3D want to project to the audience?</h4><p>Simple, rapid, technological, playful and high quality.</p></div><p>Based on the user brief, I interviewed 50 people via telephone and finally planned out our <span class="highlight">design goals</span>.</p><div class="flex wider"><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>To facilitate an intuitive and seamless experience when it comes to customizing 3D printing products</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>To design a personable and engaging user interface</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>To create convenient and powerful functionalities that can manage services and transactions</span></li></ul></div><p> Next, I will choose <span class="highlight">three representatives</span> that best accomplished our design goals. And I will talk about their design processes and implementation results.</p></div></div><div class="level" id="section2"><div class="container"><h2>START A 3D PRINT</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><h3>The Problem</h3><p>3D printing features rapid prototyping and product customization. It enables consumer products to be made on­-demand, eliminating the restriction to craftsmanship and manufacture, as well as reducing the waste from overproduction and overpricing.</p><p>On the consumer side, however their expertise, most people expressed their interests about transforming their ideas into reality and their curiosity about 3D printed objects during the interviews.</p><p>So here comes the problem—<span class="highlight">how might we get customers onboard in order to fully deliver the quality of 3D printing to them?</span></p><h3>The Analysis</h3><p>To introduce complex technology home, Tran3D must provide customers with an easy and fast channel to getting their hands on real 3D printed products. <span class="highlight">The main idea is to build a module that helps users start a 3D print and guides them quickly through a customization workflow before they reach shopping cart.</span> Some core design principles were identified:</p><div class="flex wider"><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Prominent entries—CTAs draw attentions and trigger interests. </span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Easy start—Tasks that are easier to do are a better starting point for people with low motivation (refer to BJ Fogg Behavior Model).</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Limited choices—It’s often easier to make a decision when presented with only few options.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Hidden expert-level interfaces and terminologies—Expert users are the minority.</span></li></ul></div><p>Overall, the customization workflow of 3D print should be <span class="highlight">lucid, easy, efficient, and interesting</span>.</p><h3>The Exploring</h3><p> I started my exploration by scoping the user flow into three phases: <span class="highlight">upload my models</span>, <span class="highlight">select a material category</span>, and <span class="highlight">choose a 3D printing service</span>. In this way, a complex and tedious process was effectively decomposed into parts whose tasks were easier to understand and goals were clearer to achieve.</p></div></div><div class="level level--swans-down"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="assets/img/customize-process.svg"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><p>I then played with a few key design concepts while creating mid-fidelity wireframes. Those concepts were:</p><div class="flex wider"><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Create visually striking CTAs that compel users to click.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Start from the task that is easiest and most requisite.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Unlock next phase until the current one is completed, bringing fewer choices to users.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Prioritize imperative parameters, use straightforward copies and hide expert-level content.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Integrate all three steps in one page for an unbreakable experience. This integrity keeps data consistent and interaction coherent.</span></li></ul></div><h3>The Highlight</h3><p>Starting a 3D print is a highly-focused task for users. The primary goal is to find the most suitable 3D printing service to have uploaded models well-printed. Due to 3D printing's nature, however, the task requires <span class="highlight">deep focus, manual input and selection, and back-and-forth decision makings from users</span>.</p><p>The innovation I made was utilizing <span class="highlight">SPA (Single Page Application)</span>, where users could accomplish the task all in one page. During usability testing, I noticed better results in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, causing less drop-off in this page.</p></div></div><div class="level level--swans-down"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/9TtbIMn.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3>The Result</h3><p>After unifying back-end data with team, I finalized the flow as indicated below.</p><img class="lazyload img--title" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/PEdSuT3.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/0h8jMlo.gif"/><p>It creates <span class="highlight">a clear sense of assistance</span> and <span class="highlight">reduces the unnecessity</span> to minimum so that non-expert users can understand how things work without any direct explanation. Useful images and friendly language are added throughout. It also has animations and transitions, which adds a bit of fun. I am optimistic that users will get onboard and progress through all three phases with little friction, leading to successful customizations of their 3D prints.</p></div></div><div class="level" id="section3"><div class="container"><h2>DISCOVER THE USER PROFILE</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><h3>The Problem</h3><p> Tran3D in essence is a 3D printing community where users design, prototype, sell and buy custom products and services. However, different users have different roles. Given a user,</p><div class="flex wider"><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>How can we distinguish his roles from others'?</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"> </i><span>Which functions should we assign to him?</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>How can we help showcase his characteristics and develop his own "brand"?</span></li></ul></div><h3>The Analysis</h3><p> <span class="highlight">Upon discovering a user, one has to identify that person's roles and characteristics intuitively and efficiently.</span></p><p><span class="highlight">Designers</span> productively transfer their concepts into printable designs. <span class="highlight">Manufacturers</span> register 3D printers and promote their products. And like <span class="highlight">the rest of individuals</span>, both can follow, collect or purchase what they are interested in. According to this, I listed some keywords to guide my design.</p><div class="flex wider"><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span> <b>Architecture</b>—Interpreting underlying data structure and class inheritance reduces confliction between design and development.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span><b>Hierarchy</b>—The item that first grabs the eye’s attention is at the top of the hierarchy. Each item that draws attention next is subordinate to the one before it.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span><b>Coloring</b>—One of the easiest ways to distinguish objects is through colors.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span><b>Personalization</b>—Users get motivated if they are provided with more personalized choices.</span></li></ul></div><h3>The Exploration</h3><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/4XUQk2t.jpg"/><p>After sketching out several candidates, I made the following design decisions.</p><h3 class="smaller">1. Information Architecture</h3><p> I separated users into <span class="highlight">three categories</span>: common individuals, designers and manufacturers. All types shared a same template—Basic information was listed out; designs, collections, orders, followings and followers were organized into tabs. It is worth noting that designers were given an extra section to introduce their backgrounds, concepts and portfolios while manufacturers were given a shop page and a dashboard to manage printers, orders and etc.</p></div></div><div class="level level--tropical-blue"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="assets/img/data-structure.svg"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3 class="smaller">2. Visual Hierarchy</h3><p>I used <span class="highlight">Reversed-ソ Pattern</span>—Our eye starts scanning from top left, then diagonally down, stopping at the bottom right. Within a short break, information on the top right might draw some attention. The diagonal line guides us to read the main content and the dot serves as a little weight for equilibrium. For example, the reading flow of user profile starts with avatar and username. It is followed by content categories, and a list of specific items. Finally, some user statistics that are less important are located on the top right.

Color Scheme</h3><p>I chose the color palettes similar to <span class="highlight">flat design</span>. Complementary colors made personality bold and stand out. Analogous colors kept our page clean and calm.</p></div></div><div class="level level--tropical-blue"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="assets/img/color-scheme.svg"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3 class="smaller">4. Personalization</h3><p> Besides user settings, I highlighted 'Register', 'Create' and 'Follow' buttons and <span class="highlight">encouraged users to enrich their profiles</span>. Also, behaviors such as creating and collecting would be included in followers' home feed, which <span class="highlight">kept the character active</span> in social network.</p><h3>The Result</h3><p>The following images indicate pages of common user's profile, designer's profile, user's home and user settings, respectively.</p><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/0EJxdA7.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/jaCfpzU.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/UytYApc.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/1SkH6pW.png"/></div></div><div class="level" id="section4"><div class="container"><h2>MANAGE SHOP SERVICES</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><h3>The Problem</h3><p> Tran3D schedules 3D printing services based on <span class="highlight">data and facts</span>. It is important for manufacturers to provide authentic and intriguing data. This is non-trivial work: </p><div class="flex wider"><ol><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Data encompasses various facets of 3D printing—It includes printers, materials, colors and layer thicknesses, to name a few.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Pricing strategies are extremely complex—The strategies vary from case to case and they are hard to get translated from mathematical models.</span></li></ol></div><p> Therefore <span class="highlight">how can I help them upload the data in an intuitive way</span> and <span class="highlight">how can I organize the data for a clearer reference</span>?</p><h3>The Analysis</h3><p> To get better insights, I interviewed 8 people who own 3D printers. Based on their thoughts about products and marketing, I made <span class="highlight">three personas</span>.</p><div class="board"><h3 class="smaller">Manufacturer Persona</h3><h4>Frank</h4><p>Frank, aged 32, is an assistant professor of material science at university. His lab owns 5 industrial 3D printers which could support more than 40 printable materials. Frank is very intelligent about 3D print technology and especially, he knows materials inside out. He is an expert in building mathematical models and experimenting new things.</p><h4>Sarah</h4><p>Sarah is a clerk at Tiertime, a 3D print company in Beijing. She works in service team that is responsible for a chain of 3D print services. Since she is not an expert, her job is to maintain or update data provided by her technical colleagues. In order to deal with different platforms, Sarah needs to quickly understand interfaces and exchanging information with the team.</p><h4>David</h4><p>David is a technology enthusiast and he is only 20. His father bought him a desktop-level 3D printer on his last birthday, and he wants to make the full use of it. David knows how to use the printer however, he has no idea about how to provide 3D print service—He can only create simple pricing strategies but he is not sure if they would work. </p></div><p>Their <span class="highlight">user needs</span> can be described as:</p><div class="flex wider"><ol><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span><b>Hierarchical</b>—It is easier to navigate and understand the system by organizing content hierarchically.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span><b>Standardized</b>—Interactions are using the same paradigm so that users can understand.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span><b>Complete</b>—More complete data increases a manufacturer's credibility, therefore popularity.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span><b>Intuitive</b>—Uploading data is simple, not learned.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span><b>Flexible</b>—The system allows manufacturers to manipulate, irrelevant to their backgrounds.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span><b>Foreseeable</b>—Any preview of the outcome would help manufacturers circumvent mistakes, lowering the possibility of failed strategies.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span><b>Reversible</b>—Data that is incorrect or outdated can be removed or modified.</span></li></ol></div><h3>The Exploration</h3><p>During the design process, I tried to deliver the ideas above. Here, I will illustrate one by one:</p><h3 class="smaller">1. Divide concepts into hierarchy.</h3><p> A manufacturer may lack motivation to publish all service data within a single upload. So I divided the whole process and organized them into levels. From the  shop to specific objects like printer and material, <span class="highlight">a hierarchical design</span> would very much facilitate user flows.</p></div></div><div class="level level--swans-down"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/lVKSPkM.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3 class="smaller">2. Unify layouts and interactions.</h3><p>I chose to use a page component that had consistently shown up in Tran3D—<span class="highlight">the modal</span>. This was because I did not want to overwhelm the user with an unfamiliar UI. A modal also made manufacturers concentrate on what they were doing. Within a modal, data uploading was splitted into steps and there was a top navigation bar indicating the progress. </p><h3 class="smaller">3. Include data that helps SEO and discoverability.</h3><p><span class="highlight">Titles, descriptions, tags, photos and categories</span> are properties for manufacturers to better describe their services. These features can be descriptive and educational to someone outside of their niches. Complete data speaks aloud for the services.</p><h3 class="smaller">4. Utilize shapes and colors.</h3><p>Making a pricing strategy is one of the most challenging problems in respect of interaction design—Strategies in 3D print industry involve a variety of factors, not only the physical properties but also laboring influences. </p><p>A common mathematical model is <span class="highlight">linear polynomial</span> which sums up a number of terms. The quantity of terms depends and terms are flexible since they have different interpretations. </p><p>When I tried to illustrate this polynomial using simple shapes and colors, I found that <span class="highlight">building a one-to-one correspondence between a term and a color</span> was the most intuitive solution. It turned a complex math formula into objects that can be easily cognized by human beings.</p></div></div><div class="level level--swans-down"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="assets/img/formula.svg"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3 class="smaller">5. Add flexibility to the system.</h3><p>The module must be adaptive to users with different backgrounds. Consider a user with non-expert background. He might need <span class="highlight">notes</span> for terminologies, <span class="highlight">tips</span> for interactions and <span class="highlight">default values</span> for complicated data. On the contrary, an expert might need more specifications and details. And he wants to enable more terms in the polynomial to <span class="highlight">better control</span> his pricing strategy.</p><h3 class="smaller">6. Preview simulated results.</h3><p>Manufacturers will get a <span class="highlight">live preview</span> of what the price would be after proposing a pricing strategy. The result is calculated by applying the pricing strategy to a test case we provided. It even gives an instant feedback as the user make any adjustments to the linear polynomial. This functionality helps manufacturers find a suitable pricing strategy. It also makes them feel powerful so that they can trust our system.</p><h3 class="smaller">7. Provide CRUD operations.</h3><p> Besides basic creating and reading, service data like printers, materials and even pricing strategies are <span class="highlight">revisable</span> if one made any mistakes.</p></div></div><div class="level level--swans-down"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/4eFsbvE.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3>The Result</h3><p>From the shop's public page to a modal that creates material and pricing strategies, I am satisfied that my design goals are accomplished across different pages. The design is simple yet powerful, not only providing intuitive interfaces but also tailoring to different user needs. Meanwhile, a lot of common elements are reused, contributing to the system consistency.</p><img class="lazyload img--title" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/PEdSuT3.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/oYlZBYa.gif"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/AzNhndR.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/tjILlM2.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/LkGbNOG.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h2>CONCLUSION AND REFLECTION</h2><div class="sep"></div><p>At the early stage of a startup company, I wanted to deliver a <span class="highlight">minimum viable product</span> and provide a flexible structure that could scale naturally as the website grows. Looking back, the project has included all necessary functionalities and built upon a scalable framework. It has successfully leveraged the design language to promote a high-end technology, decoding the secret of 3D printing into context that people can comprehend and make use of.</p><p>As a designer and a developer, the project also made me appreciate the importance of coordinating different perspectives and collaborating with different roles. It became one of the most precious experiences in my career.</p></div></div><nav class="dot-nav"><ul><li><a class="dot-nav--item" id="section1Nav" href="#section1"></a></li><li><a class="dot-nav--item" id="section2Nav" href="#section2"></a></li><li><a class="dot-nav--item" id="section3Nav" href="#section3"></a></li><li><a class="dot-nav--item" id="section4Nav" href="#section4"></a></li></ul></nav><div class="level"><div class="portfolio-nav-container"><div class="container"><a class="prev-container" href="bio.html"></a><a class="home-icon-container" href="index.html"></a><a class="next-container" href="denture.html"></a></div></div></div></div></div>
