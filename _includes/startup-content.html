In this article I will select three milestones during the design/development process and I will analyze each of them from strategy to interface.</p></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h2>OVERVIEW</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><h3>About the company</h3><p>Tran3D is <span class="highlight">an online 3D printing service platform where distributed 3D printing resources are gathered, shared, and applied</span>.</p><h3>How it works</h3><p> Tran3D runs a C2C business model. It facilitates transactions between <span class="highlight">3D printer owners and people who want to make 3D prints</span>. Service bureaus can join the platform to offer 3D printing services while customers can select one of the best solutions we recommend to get their 3D models printed.</p><h3>My roles</h3><p> Being one of the co-founders, I led the <span class="highlight">UI/UX design and front-end development</span> from start to finish in the past one year. </p><p>As a designer, I worked on</p><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>User research</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Sketches and wireframes</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Visual and interaction design</span></li></ul><p>As a developer, I was responsible for</p><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Writing reusable CSS</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Building application based on AngularJS and Three.js</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Designing API endpoints that could collaborate with back-end</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Loading modules with oc-lazyload and Webpack</span></li></ul><h3>How I started</h3><p>At the early stage of a startup company, <span class="highlight">I wanted to deliver a minimum viable product as soon as possible.</span> I also wanted to provide a flexible structure that could scale naturally as the website grows. So I started with architecture and decomposed it into modules.</p><p>Next, I will select three representatives and go through their design processes and implementation results.</p></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h2>START A 3D PRINT</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><h3>The Problem</h3><p>3D printing features rapid prototyping and product customization. It enables consumer products to be made on­-demand, eliminating the restriction to craftsmanship and manufacture, as well as reducing the waste from overproduction and overpricing. So here comes the problem—<span class="highlight">how can I get customers onboard and fully deliver such quality of 3D printing to them?</span></p><h3>The Analysis</h3><p>To introduce complex technology home, Tran3D must provide customers with an easy and fast channel to getting their hands on real 3D printed products. <span class="highlight">The main idea was to build a module that helps users start a 3D print and guides them quickly through a customization workflow before they reach the shopping cart.</span> I called it "Start a 3D Print" and then identified some core principles:</p><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Prominent call-to-actions—Highlighted elements draw attentions and trigger interests. </span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Refined steps—Tasks that are easier to do are a better starting point for people with low motivation (see BJ Fogg Behavior Model).</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Limited choices—It’s often easier to make a decision when presented with only a few options.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Hidden expert-level interfaces and terminologies—Expert users are only the minority.</span></li></ul><p>Overall, I wanted to make this module accessible and easy to customers and boost user engagement. The customization workflow of 3D printing should be <span class="highlight">lucid</span>, <span class="highlight">fast</span>, <span class="highlight">efficient</span>, and <span class="highlight">interesting</span>.</p><h3>The Exploring</h3><p> Based on the analysis, I started my exploration by scoping the workflow into three phases: <span class="highlight">Upload Your Models</span>, <span class="highlight">Select a Material</span>, and <span class="highlight">Choose a 3D Printing Service</span>. In this way, a complex and tedious process was effectively decomposed into parts whose tasks are easier to understand and goals are clearer to achieve.</p><p>I then started to play with a few key design concepts by creating mid-fidelity wireframes. Those concepts were:</p><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Create visually striking buttons that compel users to click. For example, 'Start a 3D Print' button at the top navigation draws attentions and gives everybody a direct access to getting started. Besides, 'Next' buttons between steps provide natural leads and transitions, which help users move forward.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Integrate all three phases in one page for an unbreakable experience. This integrity keeps data consistent and interaction coherent. And if you accidentally do something that doesn’t produce the results you were looking for, you could scroll backward for any small corrections without repeating the whole process.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Unlock the next phase until the current one is completed. Loading the customization workflow once for all adds unnecessary choices on the screen, which could heavily distract users from focusing on the current step. On the contrary, loading step by step provides better guidance and creates more interesting interactions to the system. </span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Prioritize imperative parameters, use straightforward wording and hide expert-level content. Complex interfaces and terminologies are not only overwhelming for beginners, but could also be difficult to use for experts in certain cases. Hiding some of the unimportant terminologies like 'Infill Ratio' or '3D Printing Technology' into advanced tabs could be a choice.</span></li></ul><h3>The Result</h3><p> After unifying data structure with the team, I finalized the flow as indicated below. It creates <span class="highlight">a clear sense of assistance</span> and <span class="highlight">reduces the unnecessity</span> to minimum so that most non-expert users can understand how things work without any direct explanation. Useful images and friendly language are added throughout. It also has animations and transitions, which adds a bit of fun. I am optimistic that users will get onboard and progress through all three phases without friction, leading to successful customizations of their 3D printable products.</p></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h2>DISCOVER A USER</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><h3>The Problem</h3><p> Tran3D in essence is a 3D printing community where users design, prototype, sell and buy custom products and services. However, different users have different roles. Given a user, <span class="highlight">how can we distinguish his roles from the others; which functions should we assign to him; and how can we help showcase his characteristics and develop his own "brand"?</span></p><h3>The Analysis</h3><p> To discover a user, one has to identify that person's roles and characteristics intuitively and efficiently. <span class="highlight">Designers</span> productively transfer their concepts into printable designs. <span class="highlight">Shop owners</span> register 3D printers and promote their products. Like <span class="highlight">the rest of individuals</span>, both can follow, collect or purchase what they are interested in. According to this, I drafted some key points for the design.</p></div></div></div></div>
