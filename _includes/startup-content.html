And I will talk about their design processes and deliverables.</p></div></div><div class="level" id="section2"><div class="container"><h2>START A 3D PRINT</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><h3>The Problem</h3><p>3D printing features rapid prototyping and product customization. It enables consumer products to be made on­-demand, eliminating the restriction to craftsmanship and manufacture, as well as reducing the waste from overproduction and overpricing.</p><p>On the consumer side, however their expertise, most people expressed their interests in transforming their ideas into reality and their curiosity about 3D printed objects during interviews.</p><p>So here comes the problem—<span class="highlight">how might we get customers onboard in order to fully deliver the quality of 3D printing to them?</span></p><h3>The Analysis</h3><p>To introduce complex technology home, Tran3D must provide customers with an easy and fast channel to getting their hands on real 3D printed products. <span class="highlight">The main idea is to build a module that helps users start a 3D print and guides them quickly through a customization flow before they reach the shopping cart.</span> Some core design principles were identified:</p><div class="flex wider"><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span> <b>Prominent entries</b>—CTAs draw attention and trigger interests. </span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span> <b>Easy start</b>—Tasks that are easier to do are better starting points for people with low motivation (refer to BJ Fogg Behavior Model).</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span> <b>Limited choices</b>—It’s often easier to make a decision when presented with few options.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span> <b>Hidden expert-level interfaces and terminologies</b>—Expert users are the minority.</span></li></ul></div><p>Overall, the customization flow should be <span class="highlight">lucid, efficient and interesting</span>.</p><h3>The Exploring</h3><p> I started my exploration by scoping the user flow into three phases: <span class="highlight">upload my models</span>, <span class="highlight">select a material category</span>, and <span class="highlight">choose a 3D printing service</span>. In this way, a complex and tedious process was decomposed into parts whose tasks were easier to understand and goals were clearer to achieve.</p></div></div><div class="level level--swans-down"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/3ff5edda/49d74abb.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><p>I then came up with a few design concepts while creating wireframes. Those concepts were:</p><div class="flex wider"><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Create visually striking CTAs that compel users to click.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Start from the task that is easiest and most requisite.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Unlock the next phase until the current one is completed, bringing fewer choices to users.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Prioritize imperative parameters, use straightforward copies and hide expert-level content.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Integrate all three steps in one page for an unbreakable experience. This integrity keeps data consistent and interaction coherent.</span></li></ul></div><h3>The Highlight</h3><p>Starting a 3D print is a focused job for users. Their primary goal is to find the most suitable printing service for their uploaded models. Due to 3D printing's nature, however, the task requires <span class="highlight">deep focus, manual input and selection, and back-and-forth decision-makings</span>.</p><p>My solution was utilizing <span class="highlight">SPA (Single Page Application)</span>, with which users could accomplish the task fluidly all in one page. Comparing to the multi-pages solution, I reduced the cognitive load that users took to make decisions as well as the drop-off rate caused by page-switching. During usability testing, I noticed better results in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.</p></div></div><div class="level level--swans-down"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/9e0304b9/2f30f0b6.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3>The Result</h3><p>After unifying back-end data, I finalized the flow as indicated below.</p><img class="lazyload img--title" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/ed712f48/8a05abd0.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/0h8jMlo.gif"/><p>It creates <span class="highlight">a clear sense of assistance</span> and <span class="highlight">reduces the unnecessity</span> to a minimum so that all users can understand how things work without further explanation. Useful images and friendly language are added throughout. It also has animations and transitions, which adds a bit of fun. I am optimistic that users will get onboard and progress through all three phases with little friction, leading to successful customizations of their 3D prints.</p></div></div><div class="level" id="section3"><div class="container"><h2>DISCOVER USER PROFILES</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><h3>The Problem</h3><p> Tran3D in essence is a 3D printing community where users design, prototype, sell and purchase. However, different users have different roles—<span class="highlight">Designers</span> productively transform their concepts into printable designs; <span class="highlight">manufacturers</span> register 3D printers and promote their services; and like <span class="highlight">the rest of individuals</span>, both can collect or purchase what they are interested in. So given a user,</p><div class="flex wider"><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>How can we distinguish his roles from others'?</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"> </i><span>Which features should we support?</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>How might we help showcase his characteristics and develop his own "brand"?    </span></li></ul></div><h3>The Analysis</h3><p> <span class="highlight">Upon browsing a user profile, one needs to identify that person's role and characteristics.</span> According to this, I listed some keywords for ideation purpose.</p><div class="flex wider"><ul><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span> <b>Architecture</b>—Interpreting underlying data structure and class inheritance reduces gap between design and development.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span><b>Hierarchy</b>—The item that first grabs eye's attention is at the top of the hierarchy. Each item that draws attention next is subordinate to the one before it.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span><b>Coloring</b>—One of the easiest ways to distinguish objects is through colors.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span><b>Personalization</b>—Users get motivated if they are provided with more personalized choices.</span></li></ul></div><h3>The Exploration</h3><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/22af5036/92b35628.jpg"/><p>After sketching out several candidates, I made following design decisions.</p><h3 class="smaller">1. Information Architecture</h3><p> I separated users into <span class="highlight">three categories</span>: common individuals, designers and manufacturers. All types shared a same template—Basic information was listed out; designs, collections, orders, followings and followers were organized into tabs. It is worth noting that designers were given an extra section to introduce their backgrounds, concepts and portfolios while manufacturers were given a shop page and a dashboard to manage printers, orders, etc.</p></div></div><div class="level level--tropical-blue"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/a7299e02/1e046b61.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3 class="smaller">2. Visual Hierarchy</h3><p>I used <span class="highlight">Reversed-ソ Pattern</span>—Our eye starts scanning from top left, then diagonally down, stopping at the bottom right. Within a short break, information on the top right might draw some attention. The diagonal line guides us to read the main content and the dot serves as a little weight for equilibrium.</p></div></div><div class="level level--tropical-blue"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/ab4af553/12dcdfec.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3 class="smaller">3. Color Scheme</h3><p>I chose the color palettes similar to <span class="highlight">flat UI</span>. Complementary colors made personality bold and stand out. Analogous colors kept our page clean and calm.</p></div></div><div class="level level--tropical-blue"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="assets/img/color-scheme.svg"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3 class="smaller">4. Personalization</h3><p> Besides user settings, I highlighted 'Register', 'Create' and 'Follow' buttons and <span class="highlight">encouraged users to enrich their profiles</span>. Also, behaviors such as creating and collecting would be included in followers' home feed, which <span class="highlight">kept the character active</span> in his network.</p><h3>The Highlight</h3><p>I borrowed concepts from material design and flat design to set overall visual direction. Thinking about material design, it has three-dimensional qualities that are reflected in its use of surfaces, depth, and shadows. This concept is tightly relevant to 3D prints. <span class="highlight">Match between our visual system and real world can strengthen the connection between our customers and products.</span> It also aligns with our brand image: simple, rapid and technological.</p><h3>The Result</h3><p>Following images indicate a common user's profile, a designer's profile, a user's home and settings, respectively.</p><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/2cdfb299/f29147b5.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/84dd5666/a81a5697.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/6498c546/c9c85793.png"/><img class="lazyload img--result" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/755c7009/e8e1c128.png"/></div></div><div class="level" id="section4"><div class="container"><h2>MANAGE SHOP SERVICES</h2><div class="sep taller"></div><h3>The Problem</h3><p> Tran3D schedules 3D printing services based on <span class="highlight">data and facts</span>. It is important for manufacturers to provide authentic and detailed data. This is non-trivial work: </p><div class="flex wider"><ol><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Data encompasses various facets—It includes printers, materials, colors, layer thicknesses and more at lower granularity.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span>Pricing strategies are extremely complex—They vary from case to case and are hard to get translated from mathematical models.</span></li></ol></div><p> Therefore <span class="highlight">how might we help them upload data in an intuitive or instructive way</span> and <span class="highlight">how might we organize their data for clarity purpose</span>?</p><h3>The Analysis</h3><p> To get better insights, I interviewed 8 people who owned 3D printers. Based on their backgrounds and behaviors, I made <span class="highlight">three personas</span>.</p><div class="board"><h3 class="smaller">Manufacturer Persona</h3><div class="subtitle"><h4>Frank</h4><div class="marker persona-1"></div></div><p>Frank, aged 32, is an assistant professor of material science at university. His lab owns 5 industrial 3D printers which could support more than 40 printable materials. Frank has rich knowledge about 3D printing and especially, he knows materials inside out. He is an expert in building mathematical models and experimenting new things.</p><div class="subtitle"><h4>Sarah</h4><div class="marker persona-2"></div></div><p>Sarah is an AM at Tiertime, a 3D print company in Beijing. She works for a team that is responsible for promoting their 3D printing services to all partners. Since she is not an expert, her job is to maintain or update data provided by her technical colleagues. In order to deal with different platforms from different partners, Sarah needs to quickly understand interfaces and exchanging information with the team.</p><div class="subtitle"><h4>David</h4><div class="marker persona-3"></div></div><p>David is a technology enthusiast and he is only 20. His father bought him a desktop-level 3D printer on his last birthday. He wants to make the full use of it. David knows how to use the printer but he has no idea about how to provide 3D print service—He can only create simple pricing strategies but he is not sure if they would work.</p></div><p>Their needs can be described as:</p><div class="flex wider"><ol><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span><b>Hierarchical</b>—It is easier to navigate and understand the system by organizing content hierarchically.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span><b>Standardized</b>—Interactions are using the same paradigm so that users can understand.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span><b>Complete</b>—More complete data increases a manufacturer's credibility, therefore popularity.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span><b>Intuitive</b>—Uploading data is simple, not learned.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span><b>Flexible</b>—The system allows manufacturers to manipulate, whichever their backgrounds.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span><b>Foreseeable</b>—Any preview of the outcome would help manufacturers circumvent mistakes, lowering the possibility of failed strategies.</span></li><li><i class="icon icon-li ion-chevron-right"></i><span><b>Reversible</b>—Data that is incorrect or outdated can be removed or modified.</span></li></ol></div><h3>The Exploration</h3><p>During the ideation and prototyping phase, I mapped out solutions one by one:</p><h3 class="smaller">1. Divide concepts into hierarchy.</h3><p> Manufacturers may lack motivation to publish all service data in one single use. So I divided the process and organized them into levels. From the shop to specific objects like printer and material, <span class="highlight">a hierarchical design</span> would very much facilitate user tasks.</p></div></div><div class="level level--swans-down"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/3fb890ff/ff14c6f9.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3 class="smaller">2. Unify layouts and interactions.</h3><p>I chose a component that had consistently shown up in Tran3D—<span class="highlight">the modal</span>. This was because I did not want to overwhelm users with an unfamiliar UI. A modal also made them concentrate on what they were doing while kept the background as context. Within a modal, data uploading was splitted into steps and there was a top navigation indicating the progress. </p><h3 class="smaller">3. Include data that helps SEO and discoverability.</h3><p><span class="highlight">Titles, descriptions, tags, photos and categories</span> are attributes for manufacturers to better describe their services. These content can be descriptive and educational to someone outside of their niches. Completenese of data speaks aloud for services.</p><h3 class="smaller">4. Utilize shapes and colors.</h3><p>Making a pricing strategy is one of the most challenging tasks when manufacturers manage their services—Strategies in 3D print industry involve a variety of factors, not only the physical attributes but also laboring influences. </p><p>A common practice is using <span class="highlight">linear polynomial</span> as the mathematical model which sums up a number of terms. The quantity of terms depends and each term is flexible due to possibly different interpolations. </p><p>During research, I realized that there was a huge gap between the system and its users, more specifically, the complexity that a pricing strategy could go and the capability for people to understand, digest and make adjustments for that.   </p><p>Luckily, I found that <span class="highlight">building a one-to-one correspondence between a term and a colored shape</span> was the most intuitive and efficient solution. It turned a complex math formula into objects that can be easily cognized and understood by human beings. Therefore, I illustrated this polynomial using simple shapes and colors:</p></div></div><div class="level level--swans-down"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/395fdde1/975ef99b.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3 class="smaller">5. Add flexibility to the system.</h3><p>The module must be adaptive to users with different backgrounds. Consider a user with non-expert background, he might need <span class="highlight">notes</span> for terminologies, <span class="highlight">tips</span> for interactions and <span class="highlight">default values</span> for complicated terms. On the contrary, an expert might need more specifications and details. And he wants to enable more terms in the polynomial to <span class="highlight">better control</span> his pricing strategy.</p><h3 class="smaller">6. Preview simulated results.</h3><p>Manufacturers will get a <span class="highlight">live preview</span> of what the price is after proposing a pricing strategy. The result is calculated by applying the pricing strategy to a test case we provide. It even gives instant feedback as the user makes any adjustment to the linear polynomial. This feature helps manufacturers find their suitable pricing strategies. It also makes them feel empowered so that they can trust our system.</p><h3 class="smaller">7. Provide CRUD operations.</h3><p> Service data like printers, materials and even pricing strategies are <span class="highlight">revisable</span> if one makes any mistake.</p></div></div><div class="level level--swans-down"><div class="container"><img class="lazyload" data-src="http://pic.yupoo.com/cherrychoochoo/aa628150/9c3d884d.png"/></div></div><div class="level"><div class="container"><h3>The Highlight</h3><p>I want to highlight how I understood problems and developed insights from research using  <span class="highlight">JTBD plus VPD framework</span>.
