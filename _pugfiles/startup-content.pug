                h1 Tran3D: First Class
                p Last year, I have been working on a startup project—Tran3D. In this article, I would like to share with you some of my designs from strategy to interface.

                p
                    | Tran3D is 
                    span.highlight an online 3D printing service platform
                    |  where distributed 3D printing resources are gathered, shared, and applied.
        
                h3 How it works
                p 
                    | Tran3D runs a C2C business model. It facilitates transactions between 
                    span.highlight 3D printer owners and people who want to make 3D prints
                    | . Service bureaus can join the platform to offer 3D printing services while customers can select one of the best solutions we recommend to get their customized 3D models printed.
                h3 My roles
                p 
                    | Being one of the co-founders, I led the 
                    span.highlight UI/UX design and front-end development
                    |  from start to finish last year.

                p Then I turned the design into product with code. 
                h3 How I started
                p Working closely with my partners, I first made a Q&A sheet that depicts our potential users.

                    h4 What are the audience types and their differences?
                    p 
                        | There are basically three types. 1. 
                        b Common individuals
                        | —people who need 3D printed products, but without 3D printers; 2. 
                        b Designers
                        | —people who are capable of producing high-quality 3D models consistently; 3. 
                        b Manufacturers
                        | —people who own 3D printers, can either be individuals or companies.
                    h4 Where can audiences be found?
                    p Most likely, they can be found in universities or in manufactural industry. They might also have active accounts in 3D forums.
                    h4 What personality does Tran3D want to project to the audience?
                    p Simple, rapid, technological, playful and high quality.
                p Based on the user brief, I interviewed 50 people via questionnaires and finally planned out our

                .sep.taller
                h3 The Problem
                p 3D printing features rapid prototyping and product customization. It enables consumer products to be made on­-demand, eliminating the restriction to craftsmanship and manufacture, as well as reducing the waste from overproduction and overpricing.
                p
                    | So here comes the problem—
                    span.highlight how can I get customers onboard and fully deliver such quality of 3D printing to them?
                h3 The Analysis
                p
                    | To introduce complex technology home, Tran3D must provide customers with an easy and fast channel to getting their hands on real 3D printed products. 
                    span.highlight The main idea was to build a module that helps users start a 3D print and guides them quickly through a customization workflow before they reach the shopping cart.
                    |  I called it "Start a 3D Print". Some core principles were identified:

                p
                    | Overall, I wanted to make this module accessible and easy to users and boost their engagement. The customization workflow of 3D print should be

                p 
                    | Based on the analysis, I started my exploration by scoping the workflow into three phases:

                    span.highlight Select a Material

                    span.highlight Choose a 3D Printing Service
                    | . In this way, a complex and tedious process was effectively decomposed into parts whose tasks are easier to understand and goals are clearer to achieve.

                h3 1. Divide concepts into hierarchy.
                p A manufacturer may lack motivation to publish all service data in a single upload. So I divided the whole process and organized them into levels. From the comprehensive concept of shop to specific objects like printer and material, the hierarchical design would very much facilitate user flows.
