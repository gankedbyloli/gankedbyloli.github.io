                    | At the early stage of a startup company, 
                    span.highlight I wanted to deliver a minimum viable product as soon as possible.
                    |  I also wanted to provide a flexible structure that could scale naturally as the website grows. So I started with architecture and decomposed it into modules.
                p Next, I will select three representatives and go through their design processes and implementation results.

                .sep.taller
                h3 The Problem
                p
                    | 3D printing features rapid prototyping and product customization. It enables consumer products to be made on­-demand, eliminating the restriction to craftsmanship and manufacture, as well as reducing the waste from overproduction and overpricing. So here comes the problem—
                    span.highlight how can I get customers onboard and fully deliver such quality of 3D printing to them?
                h3 The Analysis
                p
                    | To introduce complex technology home, Tran3D must provide customers with an easy and fast channel to getting their hands on real 3D printed products. 
                    span.highlight The main idea was to build a module that helps users start a 3D print and guides them quickly through a customization workflow before they reach the shopping cart.
                    |  I called it "Start a 3D Print" and then identified some core principles:
                ul
                    li
                        i.icon.icon-li.ion-chevron-right

                    li
                        i.icon.icon-li.ion-chevron-right
                        span Limited choices—It’s often easier to make a decision when presented with only a few options.

                        span Hidden expert-level interfaces and terminologies—Expert users are only the minority.
                p
                    | Overall, I wanted to make this module accessible and easy to customers and boost user engagement. The customization workflow of 3D printing should be 
                    span.highlight lucid
                    | , 
                    span.highlight fast

                    span.highlight efficient
                    | , and 
                    span.highlight interesting
                    | .
                h3 The Exploring
                p 
                    | Based on the analysis, I started my exploration by scoping the workflow into three phases: 
                    span.highlight Upload Your Models
                    | , 
                    span.highlight Select a Material
                    | , and 
                    span.highlight Choose a 3D Printing Service
                    | . In this way, a complex and tedious process was effectively decomposed into parts whose tasks are easier to understand and goals are clearer to achieve.
                p I then started to play with a few key design concepts by creating mid-fidelity wireframes. Those concepts were:
                ul
                    li
                        i.icon.icon-li.ion-chevron-right
                        span Create visually striking buttons that compel users to click. For example, 'Start a 3D Print' button at the top navigation draws attentions and gives everybody a direct access to getting started. Besides, 'Next' buttons between steps provide natural leads and transitions, which help users move forward.
                    li
                        i.icon.icon-li.ion-chevron-right
                        span Integrate all three phases in one page for an unbreakable experience. This integrity keeps data consistent and interaction coherent. And if you accidentally do something that doesn’t produce the results you were looking for, you could scroll backward for any small corrections without repeating the whole process.
                    li
                        i.icon.icon-li.ion-chevron-right
                        span Unlock the next phase until the current one is completed. Loading the customization workflow once for all adds unnecessary choices on the screen, which could heavily distract users from focusing on the current step. On the contrary, loading step by step provides better guidance and creates more interesting interactions to the system. 
                    li
                        i.icon.icon-li.ion-chevron-right
                        span Prioritize imperative parameters, use straightforward wording and hide expert-level content. Complex interfaces and terminologies are not only overwhelming for beginners, but could also be difficult to use for experts in certain cases. Hiding some of the unimportant terminologies like 'Infill Ratio' or '3D Printing Technology' into advanced tabs could be a choice.
                h3 The Result
                p 
                    | After unifying data structure with the team, I finalized the flow as indicated below. It creates 
                    span.highlight a clear sense of assistance
                    |  and 
                    span.highlight reduces the unnecessity
                    |  to minimum so that most non-expert users can understand how things work without any direct explanation. Useful images and friendly language are added throughout. It also has animations and transitions, which adds a bit of fun. I am optimistic that users will get onboard and progress through all three phases without friction, leading to successful customizations of their 3D printable products.

                p 
                    | Tran3D in essence is a 3D printing community where users design, prototype, sell and buy custom products and services. However, different users have different roles. Given a user, 
                    span.highlight how can we distinguish his roles from others'; which functions should we assign to him; and how can we help showcase his characteristics and develop his own "brand"?

                        i.icon.icon-li.ion-chevron-right
                        span I separated users into three categories: common individuals, designers and manufacturers. All types shared a same template—Basic information was listed out and designs, collections, orders, followings and followers were organized into tabs. However, it is worth noting that designers were given an extra section to introduce their backgrounds, concepts and portfolios while manufacturers were given a shop page and a dashboard to manage printers, orders and etc in the shop.

The more they participate, the easier to showcase their personality and to find their friends. Also, user behaviors such as creating and collecting were included in the home feed, which kept the character active in social network.

                p Tran3D manages and schedules 3D printing services based on data and facts. To better SEO and discoverability, it is important for manufacturers to provide authentic and intriguing data. This is a non-trivial work: 
                ol
                    li
                        i.icon.icon-li.ion-chevron-right

                    li
                        i.icon.icon-li.ion-chevron-right
                        span Pricing strategies are extremely complex—The disparity of strategies is of all aspects and the strategies are hard to understand if translated into mathematical model.
                p Therefore how can I help them upload the data in an intuitive way and how can I better organizing the data for a clearer reference?
                h3 The Analysis
                p To get better insights in manufacturers, I interviewed some people that owns 3D printers about products and marketing. With these insights I made three personas. The personas reveal the listed user needs.

                ul
                    li
                        i.icon.icon-li.ion-chevron-right
                        span Divide concepts into hierarchy. A manufacturer may not have enough motivation to publish all service data in a single upload. So I divided the whole process, and organized them into layers. A user could go to their shop settings page and upload their 3D printers first. Second, under one of his printers, he could add materials and related information. Note that a printer is not in active status until its materials are added.
                    li
                        i.icon.icon-li.ion-chevron-right
                        span Include features that helps SEO. Titles, tags, descriptions, photos and categories are provided for manufacturers to better describe their services. These features can be catchy and descriptive to someone outside of their niches, speak aloud for their services. 
                    li

                        span Utilize shapes and colors.  One of the most difficult problem is the interaction design for making a pricing strategy since it has so many variables and it is so flexible. A common mathematical model of pricing strategies is linear polynomial. It is an add-up of multiple terms which come from a coefficient multiplies a variable. Besides, the number of terms depends on specific use case. Here, I tried to illustrate this polynomial using simple shapes and colors. I found that by building a one-to-one correspondence between a term and a color could effectively solve the problem.
                    li
                        i.icon.icon-li.ion-chevron-right
                        span Unify layouts, interactions and paradigms. I chose to move forward with the page component that repetatively showed up—the modal. This was because I did not want to overwhelm the user with both an unfamiliar UI and an unfamiliar interaction. I tried to make users concentrated on what they are doing by popping out a modal. Within the modal, there is a top nav indicating the progress of uploading data. In terms technical paradigms, units of measurement and math formulas are both standardized. Manufacturers in Tran3D must obey these rules. For example, manufacturers have to use linear polynomial instead of a quadratic one for market unity.

Not every blank in the form is required. For example, manufacturers could enable factors that is particular important to them in the linear polynomial. They could even disable the default factors as long as they use the provided formula.
