                h1 Tran3D: First Class
                p Last year, I have been working on a startup project—Tran3D. In this article, I would like to share with you some of my designs from strategy to interface.

                    | Tran3D is 
                    span.highlight an online 3D printing service platform
                    |  where distributed 3D printing resources are gathered, shared, and applied.
        
                h3 How it works
                p 
                    | Tran3D runs a C2C business model. It facilitates transactions between 
                    span.highlight 3D printer owners and people who want to make 3D prints
                    | . Service bureaus can join the platform to offer 3D printing services while customers can select one of the best solutions we recommend to get their customized models printed.
                h3 My roles
                p 
                    | Being one of the co-founders, I led the 
                    span.highlight UI/UX design and front-end development
                    |  from start to finish last year.

                p Then I turned the design into product with code. 
                h3 How I started
                p Working closely with my partners, I first made a Q&A sheet that depicted our potential users.

                    h4 What are the audience types and their differences?
                    p 
                        | There are basically three types. 1. 
                        b Common individuals
                        | —people who need 3D printed products, but without 3D printers; 2. 
                        b Designers
                        | —people who are capable of producing high-quality 3D models consistently; 3. 
                        b Manufacturers
                        | —people who own 3D printers, can either be individuals or companies.
                    h4 Where can audiences be found?
                    p Most likely, they can be found in universities or in manufactural industry. They might also have active accounts in 3D print forums.
                    h4 What personality does Tran3D want to project to the audience?
                    p Simple, rapid, technological, playful and high quality.
                p Based on the user brief, I interviewed 50 people via questionnaires and finally planned out our

                h3 The Problem
                p 3D printing features rapid prototyping and product customization. It enables consumer products to be made on­-demand, eliminating the restriction to craftsmanship and manufacture, as well as reducing the waste from overproduction and overpricing.
                p
                    | So here comes the problem—
                    span.highlight how can I get customers onboard and fully deliver such quality of 3D printing to them?
                h3 The Analysis
                p
                    | To introduce complex technology home, Tran3D must provide customers with an easy and fast channel to getting their hands on real 3D printed products. 
                    span.highlight The main idea is to build a module that helps users start a 3D print and guides them quickly through a customization workflow before they reach the shopping cart.
                    |  I called it "Start a 3D Print". Some core principles were identified:

                p

                    span.highlight Select a Material

                    span.highlight Choose a 3D Printing Service
                    | . In this way, a complex and tedious process was effectively decomposed into parts whose tasks are easier to understand and goals are clearer to achieve.

                    p Frank, aged 32, is an assistant professor of material science at university. His lab owns 5 industrial 3D printers which could support more than 40 printable materials. Frank is very intelligent about 3D print technology and especially, he knows materials inside out. He is an expert in building mathematical models and experimenting new things.
                    h4 Sarah
                    p Sarah is a clerk at Tiertime, a 3D print company in Beijing. She works in service team that is responsible for a chain of 3D print services. Since she is not an expert, her job is to maintain or update data provided by her technical colleagues. In order to deal with different platforms, Sarah needs to quickly understand interfaces and exchanging information with the team.
                    h4 David
                    p David is a technology enthusiast and he is only 20. His father bought him a desktop-level 3D printer on his last birthday, and he wants to make the full use of it. David knows how to use the printer however, he has no idea about how to provide 3D print service—He can only create simple pricing strategies but he is not sure if they would work.

                p 
                    | A manufacturer may lack motivation to publish all service data within a single upload. So I divided the whole process and organized them into levels. From the  shop to specific objects like printer and material, 
                    span.highlight a hierarchical design
                    |  would very much facilitate user flows.

                p
                    | I chose to use a page component that had consistently shown up in Tran3D—
                    span.highlight the modal
                    | . This was because I did not want to overwhelm the user with an unfamiliar UI. A modal also made manufacturers concentrate on what they were doing. Within a modal, data uploading was splitted into steps and there was a top navigation bar indicating the progress. 
                h3.smaller 3. Include data that helps SEO and discoverability.
                p
                    span.highlight Titles, descriptions, tags, photos and categories
                    |  are properties for manufacturers to better describe their services. These features can be descriptive and educational to someone outside of their niches. Complete data speaks aloud for the services.
                h3.smaller 4. Utilize shapes and colors.
                p Making a pricing strategy is one of the most challenging problems in respect of interaction design—Strategies in 3D print industry involve a variety of factors, not only the physical properties but also laboring influences. 
                p
                    | A common mathematical model is

                p
                    | When I tried to illustrate this polynomial using simple shapes and colors, I found that 
                    span.highlight building a one-to-one correspondence between a term and a color
                    |  was the most intuitive solution. It turned a complex math formula into objects that can be easily cognized by human beings.

                    span.highlight better control
                    |  his pricing strategy.

It even gives an instant feedback as the user make any adjustments to the linear polynomial. This functionality helps manufacturers find a suitable pricing strategy. It also makes them feel powerful so that they can trust our system.

                p From the shop's public page to a modal that creates material and pricing strategies, I am satisfied that my design goals are accomplished across different pages. The design is simple yet powerful, not only providing intuitive interfaces but also tailoring to different user needs. Meanwhile, a lot of common elements are reused, contributing to the system consistency.
