                h1 Designing Filters in a Scientific Way
                p In this article, I will initiate an in-depth discussion about filter design on mobile devices, from research, to design, and to scale. It is based on my experience designing the core customer journey for local users at Booking.com.

Filters, when applied, not only mitigate overload by reducing thousands of products to a manageable amount but also surface choices tailored to users' interests and needs in a straightforward way.

                h3 1. Quantitative - Correlation with Business
                p 
                    | My first step was 
                    span.highlight justifying business impact
                    |  by investigating the correlation between converted users and their filtering behaviors.
                p
                    | As the graphs indicated, filtering behaviors from non-converted and converted users were not the same. On the one hand, users with stronger motivations were prone to interact with filters. On the other hand, for the group that applied any filter, the conversion rate was x% higher.
                p
                    | It showed the business value of filters as 
                    span.highlight they kept high intent users in the converting funnel
                    | .
                h3 2. Quantitative - Usability Indicators
                p I moved on to creating indicators that measured filters performance.
                p 
                    | Two fundamental indicators were sr_filter_shown and sr_filter_usage. One recorded how many users opened up the filters page while the other recorded how many users ended up applying filters. Additionally, I considered the difference between the two as 
                    span.highlight a signal that captured friction users experienced during the filtering process
                    | . The larger the difference, the worse the usability.
                p By comparing with the benchmark on mobile web, I found that filters were less frequently used and the cost was relatively high on apps.
                h3 3. Quantitative - Frequency of Use
                p I checked the applied frequency of various filter options. Undoubtedly the data was influenced by users segment and design solution, but it still inferred a general preference for prices, ratings, property types, and unique selling points from our existing users.
                h3 4. Qualitative - Guerrila Testing
                p
                    | On the qualitative side, I ran a 
                    span.highlight street testing
                    |  on a sample of 10, asking the participants to choose a stay for the forthcoming trip. 
                    span.highlight Merely interrupting, I was able to observe the most authentic user behaviors and evaluate usability closest to real situations.

                    | As a next step, I conducted a

                    |  where participants performed filter-related tasks, compare with competitors, and finally give their thoughts about the overall experience. 
                    span.highlight Users were encouraged to think aloud and provide the most meticulous feedback. 
                p Here is an excerpt of comments:
                h3 6. Qualitative - Survey
                p
                    | I also carried out a simple survey that asked people to rank the most popular filter criteria according to their preferences. For each one of them, I calculated its average and standard deviation from the ranking scores. Therefore, by picking ones with higher mean and lower standard deviation, I identified the most important and convincing decision factors—location, budget, ratings, and reviews.
                p 
                    | One noticeable gap coming into place was location filters, comparing the need and the actual usage. It could 
                    span.highlight imply the poor information validity
                    |  as the readiness of geographic data was dubious.

                    p There are three topics worth highlighting during the course of designing filters.
                    h3 1. Batch Filters vs. Interactive Filters
                    p While filters may look similar in many products, their behaviors vary widely. Can users adjust multiple filters before the results of the compound query are returned, or are the results returned after each filter value is specified? Answers to the question indicate two different filtering mechanism: batch filters and interactive filters. Choosing between a batch and an interactive filter implementation will depend on user intent and site speed. 
                    p Exploratory users who do not have a clear search goal still need to learn about the structure of the search space and the possible options. These users will benefit most from interactive filtering. Alternatively, determined users who already have multiple criteria in mind will benefit from batch filtering. However, it is difficult to accurately predict users’ mindset while they are filtering. In this case, one solution is letting users tell you when they’re done selecting filters. This essentially means to include an apply button in the filter design. Users can click on that button once they’ve indicated all the filter values that they are interested in. This method gives flexibility to both exploratory and determined users.
                    p Site speed is a much more obvious factor. If you expect the queries to be instantaneous then interactive filtering will be less offensive. If however your product is likely to be slow, then the batch filtering can save users some wait time.
                    p To conclude, knowing when to stop and apply filters is key to allowing users smoothly progress towards their goals while maintaining a sense of UI stability and user mastery.
                    h3 2. Powerful Equals Optimal?
                    p Usually powerful features increase users’ capability and flexibility. However, this rule does not apply everywhere. A more powerful filtering feature does not necessarily guarantee an optimal user experience. 
                    p The first example is about dynamic filtering mechanism, which is popular among e-commerce giants, e.g. Taobao, and JD.com. The reasons why they stick to this pattern are because 1) they have countless commodities; 2) commodities are mainly physical; 3) servers are robust and reliable. Compared with them, 1) Booking.com has relatively small inventory in domestic market; 2) commodities are heavily influenced by seasons; 3) servers are remote and slow. In this case, if I apply the same solution, users are more likely to see drastic page refreshes or filter shifts, which severely disrupt their filtering process.
                    p Another example is about separating the location filters. Due to the immaturity of current geographical information and the misplacement of map feature, I proposed to postpone this separation.
                    p To summarize, the design for filters was heavily influenced by

                    h3 3. Overfiltering
                    p I found that the more I encouraged customers to use filter in an effective and efficient way, the more they would encounter zero-result situations, where the empty state of search results kicked in.
                    p We believe that instead of preventing overfiltering, a better solution is to build an informative, robust and scalable empty state as it ensures more flexibility and better guidance to customers. When users are getting 0 matching properties,
