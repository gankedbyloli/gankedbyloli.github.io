                    span.highlight justifying business impact

                p 
                    | Two fundamental indicators were sr_filter_shown and sr_filter_usage. One recorded how many users opened up the filters page while the other recorded how many users ended up applying filters. Furthermore, I considered the difference between the two as 
                    span.highlight a signal that captured the friction users experienced during the filtering process
                    | . The larger the difference, the worse the usability.
                p
                    | Another metric to look at was 
                    span.highlight the distribution of different amounts of applied filters
                    | , e.g. sr_applied_1_filter and sr_applied_2_filters. Increases in average and slope may inform better ease of use.
                h3 3. Quantitative - Frequency of Use
                p I checked the applied frequency of various filter options. Undoubtedly the data was influenced by user persona and design solution, but it still inferred a general preference for price, location, rating, and property type.

                p
                    | I grouped the perceptions into three aspects, namely,

                h3 5. Qualitative - Lab Study
                p
                    | As a next step, I conducted a 
                    span.highlight lab study
                    |  where participants performed filter-related tasks, compared with competitors, and finally gave their thoughts about the overall experience.

                p
                    | I also carried out a survey that asked people to rank the filter criteria according to their preferences. For each criterion, I calculated its 
                    span.highlight average
                    |  and 
                    span.highlight standard deviation
                    |  of the ranking scores. Therefore, by picking ones with higher means and lower standard deviations, I identified the most popular decision-making factors, that were, location, price, rating, and review.

                h3 1. Batch Filters vs. Interactive Filters
                p
                    | While filters look similar in many products, their behaviors vary widely. Can users adjust multiple filters before the results of the compound query are returned, or are the results returned after each filter value is specified? Answers indicate 
                    span.highlight two filtering mechanisms
                    | : batch filters and interactive filters. Choosing between a batch and an interactive implementation mainly depends on 
                    span.highlight user intent and site speed
                    | .

                    span.highlight Exploratory users
                    |  who do not have a clear search goal need to learn about the search space and the possible options. These users will benefit most from interactive filtering. Alternatively, 
                    span.highlight determined users
                    |  who already have multiple criteria in mind will benefit from batch filtering. But how to predict users’ mindsets while they are filtering? In this case, one solution is 
                    span.highlight letting users tell us when they’re done selecting filters
                    | . It means to include an apply button in the filter design. Users can click on that button once they’ve indicated all the preferrable filter values.
                p
                    | Site speed is a much obvious factor. If we expect the queries to be instantaneous, then interactive filtering will be less offensive. If the product is likely to be slow, then batch filtering can save users some waiting time.
                p
                    | To summarize, 
                    span.highlight knowing when to stop and apply filters

                    span.highlight However, the most advanced filters do not necessarily guarantee optimal user experiences.

                    | The first example is about 
                    span.highlight dynamic filtering
                    | , being popular among e-commerce giants like Taobao and JD.com. The reasons why they stick to this pattern are 1) they have thousands of commodities 2) commodities are mainly tangible 3) servers are robust and reliable. Compared with them, 1) accommodations form a relatively small inventory 2) accommodations are intangible, heavily influenced by seasons 3) servers are remote and slow. In this case, if I appled the same solution, users were more likely to see drastic filter shifts and page re-structures, which 
                    span.highlight severely disrupted their filtering process
                    | .
                p 
                    | Another example is about 
                    span.highlight separating the location filters
                    | . Due to the immaturity of current geographical information and the misplacement of map feature, I proposed to defer this separation.
