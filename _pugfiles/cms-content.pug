                h3 General Problems
                p After piloting a few marketing and operation programs, results were less than satisfactory. Three critical issues were identified from the product and design side.

                p
                    | The first step I took was understanding the structure and hierarchy of content. I wanted to 
                    span.highlight identify and extract patterns that can be generalized
                    |  into tools and processes.
                p
                    | Since our main approach is listing featured properties, incentives, or articles, I categorized all campaigns into two: 
                    span.highlight commodity-focused
                    |  and 
                    span.highlight inspiration-focused
                    | . The former exploits business opportunity, incentivizing customers to book immediately while the latter offers inspirational context to trigger customer interest before any travel plan.
                p
                    | I created 
                    span.highlight mind mappings
                    |  of the two—different page elements were generalized and extracted. Each of them fell into a specific hierarchy, whether it was 
                    span.highlight a template, a pattern, a component, or an atom

                p 
                    | This approach, in a very logical way, showed elements and their associations. Besides, I saw strong correlations between the results and the information architecture of CMS. 
                p
                    | Note that I also included items that were optional or foreseeable because creating placeholders for them would make the system

                h3 2. Content Generation Flow
                p
                    | The process of forming a content structure was essentially an inverse of how I decomposed it. The concept is similar to 
                    span.highlight Atomic Design
                    |  in which everything begins with the smallest element of the interface: the atom, then forms molecule, organism, template and eventually the page.

                p
                    | This process brought insights to the workflow that our operation team would follow to generate the content: 
                    span.highlight 1. create a blank page
                    | , 
                    span.highlight 2. choose a template
                    | , 
                    span.highlight 3. create modular sections
                    | , 
                    span.highlight 4. add components
                    | , and 
                    span.highlight 5. populate data, copy and visual elements
                    | .
                h3 3. Design Values and Guideline
                p
                    | Although campaign content is highly diversified and flexible, it should not drift too much away from the personality that our products have already had. In this case, we wanted to  
                    span.highlight set up a design guideline
                    |  that all generated content can automatically follow.

                p
                    | By envisioning the campaign page and comparing it to our general product, we discovered generality in terms of clarity and effectiveness, yet peculiarity in terms of intriguing and delightful experience. Therefore we decided to set 
                    span.highlight clarity and interestingness
                    |  as our design values.
                p

                    |  components. I also dissected the generic component and rethought about its variations by adding or removing an atom in it.
