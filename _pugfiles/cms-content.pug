                p After piloting a few marketing and operation programs, results were less than satisfactory. Three critical issues were identified from the product and design side.

                p
                    | Since our main approach is listing featured properties, incentives, or articles, I categorized all campaigns into two: 
                    span.highlight commodity-focused
                    |  and 
                    span.highlight inspiration-focused

                p
                    | I created 
                    span.highlight mind mappings

                p
                    | The process of forming a content structure was essentially an inverse of how I decomposed it. The concept is similar to

                    span.highlight 2. choose a template

                p
                    | Although campaign content is highly diversified and flexible, it should not drift too much away from the personality that our products have already had. In this case, we wanted to  
                    span.highlight set up a design guideline
                    |  that all generated content can automatically follow.

                p
                    | By envisioning the campaign page and comparing it to our general product, we discovered generality in terms of clarity and effectiveness, yet peculiarity in terms of intriguing and delightful experience. Therefore we decided to set
