                    | I started by brainstorming and dividing the design process into 6 steps:

                    | . 
                h3 Competitors
                p My personal experience tells me that a team manager is often overwhelmed with members, projects, reports and other management issues, struggling to lead the team and move the work forward.
                p I was then wondering if there exist some products in the market dealing with this problem. What are the ways in which they help people stay organized? What authorities are managers entitled with while using the products? And lastly, are there any innovative methods that facilitate team management? I listed several team/project management products as our "competitors" and then studied their products briefly.

                h3 Interviews
                p 
                    | By analyzing current products, I gained a lot of inspirations. However, I also realized that those "competitors" are mainly 
                    span.highlight designed for every member on the team rather than the manager specifically
                    | . They solve the problem of project/task management within a flattened team. The idea of leadership is weakened however.
                p
                    | Therefore, I conducted 5 interviews (
                    span.highlight different industries
                    | ) to get more insights on the idea of "managing a team". I asked both qualitative and quantitative questions and observed how people would lead or manage their teams.
                p Qualitative questions might be:

                            span How frequent do you receive notifications from your team members?
                p There were some interesting findings from the interview: 1. People mainly use team management tool in office; 2. They are actually flexible about their management strategies, e.g. Tendencies towards projects and members vary from person to person; 3. People prefer a team with less than 15 people;  4. Quick and effective communication is key to success in their minds.

                    | Manipulations of the tool should be highly effective. I wanted to use the 
                    span.highlight button-modal interaction
                    |  to give more immersive experiences. Meanwhile, the way a manager 
                    span.highlight deals with requests and reports
                    |  would be intuitive. Plus, I provided 
                    span.highlight filtering and sorting
                    |  functions for managers to compare and thus get better insights.

                p
                    | Providing Interactions among team members is the key to a successful team. There are several ways to do so: 1. The tool contains 
                    span.highlight a variety of approaches
                    |  to group learning and discussions. 2. Communication through the tool is 
                    span.highlight fast
                    |  and 
                    span.highlight in-time. 
                p
                    | I therefore designed multiple ways that supported all types of communication—different organizations, requests and reports, and direct messaging and notification system.

                p
                    | A manager builds his leadership in his own manner, either in a strict or loose way. Our design should be prepared for each situation. First, our dashboard should include a 
                    span.highlight customization functionality
                    | . Manager would easily select information that is needed for him. Second, the system should contain a 
                    span.highlight rewarding or punishment
                    |  system. Third, managers are able to control their authorities by 
                    span.highlight assigning and withdrawing roles
                    |  to a team member. In these ways, 
                    span.highlight a flexible management
                    |  is achieved.

                p In the end, I used heuristic evaluations to briefly judge this team management tool. I felt like the design was far from success. It has the following weaknesses.

                p Therefore I would continue to iterate and refine the experience. 
                p Looking forward, I would also start exploring how to integrate the experience into other contexts. For instance, I would revamp the tool towards team assistant or other team members. Also, I would help the tool get deployed to other platforms such as tablets or mobile phones so that more people within more scenarios would use it.
