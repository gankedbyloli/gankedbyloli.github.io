                h2 CONTEXT
                .sep.taller
                p I have had the pleasure making a new identity for Guhao Dental Laboratory, which offers quality craftsmanship ranging from denture products to orthodontic solutions.
                p 
                    | The company is now facing new challenges and opportunities as it incorporates digitalization and 3D printing into its business. Due to this transformation, Guhao needed some design help to create a fresh 
                    span.highlight brand identity
                    | , as well as to build a 
                    span.highlight public website
                    |  for promotional use.

                h2 BRAND IDENTITY
                .sep.taller
                p I started with creating a brand identity that sets the basic tone for further design and development.
                h3 Goals
                p 
                    | Working closely with the founders, we first made sure that the key product questions were addressed in the

                    h4 Who are the target audiences?
                    p The majority of audiences are dentists, dental clinics and stomatological hospitals. A minority would be patients whom are targeted directly.
                    h4 What makes Guhao unique?
                    p 
                        | 1. 
                        b Accurate
                        | —3D scanning eliminates unnecessary errors and improves the fidelity of dental model reconstructions; 2. 
                        b Rapid
                        | —3D printing allows the lab to automate and optimize denture production workflows. 3. 
                        b Economical
                        | —The production is very efficient because digitalization and 3D printing save the cost of energy and labor in a long run.
                    h4 What product characteristics does Guhao want to promote?
                    p Healthy, fast, economical, enduring and most importantly, high-tech.
                h3 Inspirations
                p After researching into the workflow, I gradually understood how things worked out in a dental lab and especially how 3D scanning and 3D printing influenced its production pipeline. I collected the following inspirations for logo design.

                h3 Logo
                p 
                    | The logo itself is an abstraction of tooth viewed in 3D space. It is created in a style that appears to be 
                    span.highlight perspective, simple and modern
                    | . The main idea is not only introducing 
                    span.highlight the efficiency of advanced technology
                    |  but also preserving 
                    span.highlight the proficiency of traditional craftsmanship
                    | . 
                img(data-src="assets/img/logo.jpg").lazyload.img--result
                p 
                    | The logo is divided into layers in its bottom half. Why? Because this explains how 3D printer works in prototyping—a wax pattern of denture model is built 
                    span.highlight layer by layer
                    | . Considering each layer a horizontal cross-section of the tooth, a 3D printer accumulates and stacks these layers, one upon the other, to form the final mass. 
                p
                    | On the other hand, the geometry and space in between simulate the incisions 
                    span.highlight carved out
                    |  by artisans, indicating the dedication to craftsmanship.
                p Below are a collection of logos in different themes.
                img(data-src="assets/img/logo-collection.jpg").lazyload.img--result
                p 
                    | The 
                    span.highlight transformation
                    |  of the logo, from bottom to top, from layers to solid, reveals the workflow of producing dental products in Guhao. Meanwhile, the straight lines and sharp corners indicate the efficiency and proficiency the company has been equipped with.
                h3 Color Palette
                p
                    | With the metaphor of 
                    span.highlight health and technology
                    | , I chose to use cold colors of 
                    span.highlight blue and green
                    |  to form the color palette. Logo and the public website are consistent in regard of coloring.

                h2 PUBLIC WEBSITE
                .sep.taller
                p
                    | I led the design and development of public website. The 
                    span.highlight architecture
                    |  work was started first, then 
                    span.highlight wireframes
                    |  and finally 
                    span.highlight a live website
                    |  was created iteratively through the development phase.
                h3 Architecture
                p By dividing services and products into modules, I created the information architecture. Top-level modules are:
                ul
                    li
                        i.icon.icon-li.ion-chevron-right

                        i.icon.icon-li.ion-chevron-right
                        span Company—introduction, news, articles and partners of the company 
                    li
                        i.icon.icon-li.ion-chevron-right
                        span Products—denture and orthodontic products, dental implants as a plus
                    li
                        i.icon.icon-li.ion-chevron-right

                h3 Wireframes
                p I then went through a quick process of wireframing. Some were sketched out by hand and some were created using computer.

                    span.highlight collapse
                    |  into a hamburger menu on the mobile version.

                h2 CONCLUSION AND REFLECTION
                .sep.taller
                p 
                    | I felt really excited that I had the practical chance to rebrand a product, from bootstrapping the brand identity to building a public website. It made me more than happy seeing 
                    span.highlight a finished product
                    | , incorporating the ideas of design, technology as well as business.
                p 
                    | More importantly, working with Guhao Dental Lab substantiated the value of 
                    span.highlight collaboration
                    | . Designers have to fully understand what their clients need before they dive into details. And I realized that the design should reflect the value of an enterprise in order to stand out from competitors.
